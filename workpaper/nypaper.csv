https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/arts/music/geffen-hall-new-york-philharmonic-lincoln-center.html,arts,"The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a devastating blow to performing arts institutions nationwide, closing their theaters and robbing them of ticket revenue. But for the New York Philharmonic and Lincoln Center, it has also offered a silver lining: the opportunity to accelerate , of David Geffen Hall.,With concerts in the hall canceled since March 2020, construction began in earnest over the past few months. Work is expected to continue for the next year and a half, with a reopening planned for fall 2022, the orchestra and center announced on Monday.,That is a year and a half ahead of schedule, though it comes with the trade-off that the Philharmonic will not be at Geffen for the wave of triumphant cultural homecomings expected around the country this fall, assuming the pandemic ebbs.,The orchestra will nevertheless still spend much of its coming season at Lincoln Center, with the majority of its performances at Alice Tully Hall or the Rose Theater. Though it plans to announce its full program in early June, Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic’s chief executive, said in a video interview with other orchestra and center leaders that she anticipated smaller-scale and intermissionless concerts, at least at first.,It has been, Borda said, “the single most challenging season I’ve programmed.” But, she added, “I think there’s going to be an explosion of pent-up audience demand. How many more Zoom concerts can we stream?”,The Geffen Hall renovation is expected to cost $550 million, of which $500 million has been raised, Henry Timms, the president of Lincoln Center, said in the interview. He added that “significant” individual donations had been pledged, but that he was not ready to announce other naming gifts beyond the $100 million from the entertainment mogul David Geffen , in 2015.,“Through 2020, quite rightly, people’s minds were elsewhere, and we had lots of other challenges as organizations,” Timms said. “But once we got to the end of the year, the opportunity became clear: Could we do this sooner? That became a period in which a lot of people stepped up to support the project, because they saw it as a recovery story, a way to invest in the economic and human recovery of the city.”,The old plan had called for progression in stages to limit disruption to the Philharmonic, which would never have lost a full season in the hall. Katherine Farley, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center’s board, said the new timeline would not diminish the scope of the renovation, which aims to render the lackluster hall more aesthetically and acoustically appealing. Seating will wrap around the stage, which will be pulled forward 25 feet to what is currently Row J, bringing a greater sense of intimacy to what can feel like a cavernous shoe box. The new space will have about 2,200 seats, down from 2,738.,The walls will be resurfaced to improve the hall’s resonance, especially bass frequencies. The cramped lobbies and other public spaces will be expanded and improved by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, who in 2019 joined a team that also includes Diamond Schmitt Architects, which is working on the auditorium’s interior; Akustiks, an acoustical design firm; and Fisher Dachs Associates, a theater design firm.,The Philharmonic has not gone entirely dark during the pandemic. In late summer and early fall last year, it brought small groups of musicians around the city , for pop-up performances, and has said it will be back on the road this spring. Its , subscription streaming service was unveiled in February, featuring archival concerts and ,. On ,, a contingent of players will appear in front of small audiences at the Shed, 30 blocks south of Lincoln Center, with the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. (Jaap van Zweden, the Philharmonic’s music director, was not available because of commitments overseas, though he was in New York recently to tape two programs for NYPhil+.),But its losses have been crushing. , that the cancellation of its 2020-21 season resulted in $21 million in lost ticket revenue, on top of $10 million lost in the final months of its season last spring. (Some of that has been mitigated by emergency fund-raising.) Even when live performances resume, despite Borda’s rosy predictions, the box office may not bounce back immediately.,The need for savings that will extend beyond the pandemic was reflected in a new four-year contract agreed to by the orchestra and its musicians in December, which includes a 25 percent cut to the players’ base pay through August 2023. Pay will then gradually increase until the contract ends in September 2024, though at that point the musicians will still be paid less than they were before the pandemic.,The renovation of Geffen Hall — which opened in 1962 as Philharmonic Hall and was called Avery Fisher Hall starting in 1976 — has been pending and put off for years, cycling through plans and architects. At one point in the early 2000s, the exasperated Philharmonic , to its old home, Carnegie Hall; that plan fizzled, further damaging relations between the orchestra and Lincoln Center, its landlord, which also uses the hall for its own musical presentations and for corporate rentals. Concluding in 2012, a $1.2 billion redevelopment of the center left improvements all over — but the costly hall overhaul ,.,Then, in 2015, Geffen , with the donation that gave the hall his name. Construction was supposed to start in 2019, but stalled well before that amid logistical problems and management turnover at both the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center. That plan had called for finishing the hall in time for the 2021-22 season. It was a schedule that the orchestra and center came to doubt was viable, but had they been able to stick to it, the renovated hall would have been ready to open just as the city hopes to emerge from the long pandemic closure.,Borda , in large part to put the renovation back on track; in her previous job leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic, she had brought the construction of Walt Disney Concert Hall over the finish line. In New York, she pushed for a scheme less flashy and more achievable than some of the proposed options — one less likely to overrun its budget and designed to unfold in phases, limiting the stretches the Philharmonic would be exiled.,To be away from the hall for multiple years was assumed to pose an existential threat to its audience’s loyalty. Ironically, if Geffen reopens as now scheduled, the orchestra will have been out of its home for nearly two and a half seasons straight — exactly the situation that was so feared by its management.,As for David Geffen, who , in the years since his gift, Farley said in the interview that she had just spoken to him earlier that day.,“He’s a guy who’s big on efficiency,” she said, “and loves the idea we’re building it in one shot.”"

The number of vaccinated New Yorkers ,.,And now, more than a year after the coronavirus pandemic suddenly brought down the curtain at theaters and concert halls across the city, darkening Broadway and comedy clubs alike, the performing arts are beginning to bounce back.,Like budding flowers awakening just in time for spring, music, dance, theater and comedy , this past week as venues , with limited capacity — in most cases, for the first time since March 2020.,Many did.,Audiences came back, too. With face coverings and health questionnaires, they returned to an Off Broadway theater in Union Square, streamed into the Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village and took in live music at the Shed. , with the dancer Savion Glover and the actor Nathan Lane performing inside the St. James Theater; ,; ,. And more events, including a concert by New York Philharmonic musicians that will inaugurate ,, are coming soon.,But the pandemic remains unwieldy in New York, and across the country. ,, with new cases holding stubbornly at around 25,000 a week. Alongside a rush to vaccinate, variants persist. And at least one set of performances , because of positive tests.,All of which leaves arts institutions seeking to strike a delicate balance between persistent public health concerns and the desire to serve wearied New Yorkers eager for a sense of normalcy.,Reporters from The New York Times visited some of the first indoor performances, and spoke with the pioneering audience members and staff who took them in. Here is what they saw.,March 31,Isaac Alexander, 25, was walking to the Guggenheim Museum on a drizzly Wednesday evening with headphones in, dancing to the beat of Byrell the Great’s “,” and casually voguing as he passed apartment buildings on the Upper East Side.,He was on his way to support a friend in Masterz at Work Dance Family, a performance group led by Courtney ToPanga Washington, a trans-femme choreographer from the ballroom scene. Once Alexander reached the museum, he was directed into the Guggenheim’s rotunda and shown a spot to stand along its spiral ramp. Like other audience members he was masked, and was asked to leave immediately after the show as a safety measure.,“You can take any venue, put a stage in it, invite people, and you can make it a ball,” said Alexander, an artist who dances in the ballroom scene himself.,The show — a fusion of street dance, ballroom, and hip-hop — was allowed in the rotunda after the state had inspected it and given the , series a special dispensation to hold socially distanced performances there. The cast of nine, along with Washington, had spent two weeks in a quarantine bubble together in upstate New York, their housing, meals and coronavirus testing paid for while they rehearsed.,With a pounding beat in the background, the dancers moved through intricate formations, some waiting on the outskirts as solos and duets took the spotlight. There was popping and locking, pirouetting, somersaulting, duck walking (a low, bouncing walk) and cat walking (a stylized walk with popped hips and dropped shoulders) in exacting synchronicity.,Looking down from his perch, Alexander cheered the dancers on through the 30-minute work. He said that he had not seen a show since January 2020, before the pandemic shutdown. As an artist who gets ideas from watching his peers, he felt joy at the sight of a live performance.,“Now that we’re opening back up, I feel my wings coming back,” he said. “The inspiration is coming back.” JULIA JACOBS,April 2,It was the middle of the afternoon on a Friday, an unusual time for a show but nonetheless the opening of , at the Daryl Roth Theater. Only about 60 people were allowed to attend. Bundled in the parkas, they lined up on the sidewalk along East 15th Street, standing on green dots.,Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived, adding an element of pomp to what was otherwise an Off Broadway sound show. Staff members at the theater donned emerald green jackets and matching green face coverings — “Green for go!” one employee said — that hid the smiles their eyes betrayed. For about 10 minutes, the scene near Union Square felt like a cross between a political campaign event and a Hollywood premiere.,“This is a really powerful moment,” de Blasio said on the steps of the Daryl Roth’s entrance. “Theater returns to New York City. The curtain goes back up, and something amazing happens,He and the producer Daryl Roth, the theater’s namesake, greeted patrons waiting to be let inside. A few thanked the mayor for helping ensure that the performing arts return. Some asked for a selfie; others exchanged wrist and elbow bumps. There were theatergoers celebrating birthdays, people eager to post on social media, and one artistic director from San Francisco who had come to do some research on safety for whenever his playhouse reopens.,As members of the audience entered the theater, they held up their wrists to a machine that checked their temperatures. An usher led them to their seats, which came in pods and were spread out under a maze of fluorescent tubes. Once everyone was settled in, a welcome message sounded from speakers; it was greeted with a cheer.,The small crowd took out headphones, from sealed bags hanging on their chairs, and fitted them over their ears. One couple held hands. A man closed his eyes. And “Blindness,” an immersive audio adaptation of the dystopian novel by the Nobel Prize-winning novelist José Saramago, began.,For the next 75 minutes, the audience members heard of a city plagued by an epidemic of blindness. For long periods, the people in their seats were plunged into total darkness; but toward the end of the show, there were ,.,“It was bracingly familiar,” Dean Leslie, 58, said after the show. “One of the moments that really resonated with me is now — when I got back on the street.”,“It’s poetic,” he added. “It’s is something we’ve all lived. This is something we’ve shared now.” MATT STEVENS,April 2,“Make sure they’re practicing social distancing!” one security guard called to another as people descended into the Comedy Cellar’s dimly lit basement.,About 50 audience members — a crowd of mostly 20-somethings who were savvy enough to snap up tickets online — settled around their tables for the club’s first live show in over a year.,Outside, two 23-year-olds waited on the sidewalk hoping in through the waiting list; they had moved to New York City in the fall and had chosen to live together in the West Village because of the nearby music venues and comedy clubs, none of which they had been able to visit until Friday.,John Touhey, 27, who was lucky enough to snag tickets for this first show, said that his reason for coming was simple: “Just to feel something again.”,Down in the club, the show’s host, Jon Laster, hopped onstage with a triumphant yell, “Comedy Cellar, how you feelin’?” Some audience members had taken off their masks immediately when they reached their tables; others waited until their food and drinks arrived.,The pandemic was an inevitable theme of the night: It had dominated the lives of everyone in the room for the past year. Laster quizzed the mostly white crowd on where they had escaped to during the pandemic months (Kansas City, Mo., Savannah, Ga., Atlanta). As he introduced each comic onto the stage, he unplugged his mic, allowing the performers to insert their clean microphones, whose spherical tops had disposable covers that looked like miniature shower caps.,Only a third of the space’s capacity was allowed in, but the small crowd’s laughter filled the room. And the comedians talked to the audience members like they were old friends catching up after a year apart. Gary Vider joked about his new baby; Tom Thakkar recounted his drunken celebrations when President Biden won the election; Colin Quinn wondered why the subway still stank without crowds; and Jackie Fabulous told stories about living with her mother again for the first time in 20 years.,Partway through her set, Fabulous paused and took a breath.,“I feel the adrenaline,” she said. “It’s finally calming down.” JULIA JACOBS,April 2,Toward the final third of a performance that had mixed ambient sound, classical cello, operatic vocals, pop music and more, Kelsey Lu emerged in a pink, floral costume and offered a proclamation: “Spring has sprung.”,The crowd of about 150 inside the Shed’s airy McCourt space chuckled. And when Lu’s performance was over, audience members did something they have not been able to do indoors for more than a year: They gave a standing ovation.,“You could feel it,” said Gil Perez, the Shed’s chief visitor experience officer. “The excitement, the fun, the energy of a live show — there’s nothing like it.”,The McCourt, the Shed’s flexible indoor-outdoor venue, touts a cavernous size (17,000-square-feet) and a high-quality air filtration system. Attendees entered from doors that led directly into the space, and their temperatures were checked immediately. Digital programs were summoned on smartphones using a bar code on the arm of the seats, which were arranged in singles and pairs spaced roughly 12 feet from the stage, and six feet or more from one another.,Staff checked in the audience with tablets. Ticket holders were required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test; they scrolled through their phones to bring it up. Once cleared, they stepped into a timed-entry line: one for 7:40 p.m., and another for 10 minutes later.,“I’m an essential worker,” Roxxann Dobbs, a 37-year-old letter carrier, said as she waited to be let in. “I’ve been working this entire time, so it’s nice to be able to go out and have fun.”,Ian Plowman, her husband, added: “I feel like we’re on the edge of the next time in New York, the next period.”,Before and after the show, people caught the glances of old friends and stopped by their seats to chat. One woman congratulated another on getting a coronavirus vaccine. A person leaned over to a friend and remarked: “This is so nice!”,Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive, said he got “quite emotional” as the evening came to a close and he thought about Lu’s description of a spring awakening.,“Very beautiful,” he said. “I missed this so much.” MATT STEVENS"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/theater/broadway-reopening.html,arts,"Three hundred and eighty-seven days after Broadway went dark, a faint light started to glimmer on Saturday.,There were just two performers — one at a time — on a bare Broadway stage. But together they conjured up decades of theater lore, invoking the songs and shows and stars that once filled the grand houses in and around Times Square.,The 36-minute event, before a masked audience of 150 scattered across an auditorium with 1,700 seats, was the first such experiment since the coronavirus pandemic caused all 41 Broadway houses to close on March 12, 2020, and industry leaders are hoping it will be a promising step on what is sure to be a slow and bumpy road to eventual reopening.,The dancer Savion Glover and the actor Nathan Lane, both of them Tony Award winners, stood in for a universe of unemployed artists and show-starved fans as they performed a pair of pieces created for the occasion.,Mr. Glover, a renowned tap dancer, performed an improvisational song-and-dance number in which he seemed to summon specters of productions past. He walked onstage, removed the ghost light that by tradition is left on to keep spirits away from an unoccupied theater, and began to sing lyric samples, accompanied only by the sound of his bright white tap shoes. “God I hope I get it,” he began, citing the yearning theme of “A Chorus Line.”,And from there, he was off, quoting from “The Tap Dance Kid,” “Dreamgirls,” “42nd Street” and other shows that he said had influenced him, often celebrating the urge to dance, while also acknowledging the challenges of the entertainment industry. (“There’s no business like show business,” he sang, before adding, “Everything about it is eh.”) He also made a pointed reference to Black life in the U.S., interpolating the phrase “knee-on-your-neck America” into a song from “West Side Story.”,“I was a little nervous, but I was elated, and happy, and there was nostalgia, and I was sentimental — it was everything,” he said in an interview afterward. “And I felt very safe. I want to be rubbing elbows and hugging — we’re looking for that eventually — but there’s no more safe place than right in the middle of that stage.”,Mr. Lane, one of Broadway’s biggest stars, performed a comedic monologue by Paul Rudnick, in which he portrayed a die-hard theater fan (with an alphabetized Playbill collection) who dreams (or was it real?) about a parade of Broadway stars, led by Hugh Jackman, Patti LuPone and Audra McDonald, arriving at his rent-controlled apartment and vying for his attention while dishily one-upping one other. (“Have you ever heard of a little show called ‘Evita’?” Ms. LuPone, Broadway’s original Eva Perón, asks Mr. Jackman, to which he retorts, “I loved the movie with Madonna,” at which point Ms. LuPone grabs a steak knife.),In an interview after the event, Mr. Lane said: “These are baby steps toward a real reopening. It’s a way of signaling to everyone that we’re coming back.”,And did he feel safe? “I felt as safe as anyone who has been vaccinated and tested 123 times,” he said. “I’ve been swabbed. I’ve been hosed down. There were a lot of precautions and protocols, so yes, I felt safe.”,The event’s safety measures included the limited audience, mandatory masks and socially distanced seating. Plus, all attendees were required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test or a completed vaccination regimen and to fill out a digital questionnaire attesting to an absence of Covid-19 symptoms or recent exposure; attendee arrival times were staggered; there was no intermission, food or drink; and although bathrooms were open, attendees were encouraged to use a bathroom before arriving to reduce potential crowding.,The St. James, a city historic landmark built in 1927, was chosen in part because it’s big — one of the largest theaters on Broadway — and empty. The theater also has a modern ventilation system, which was installed when the building was expanded in 2017, and its air filters were upgraded during the pandemic in an effort to reduce the spread of airborne viruses.,The theater’s owner, Jordan Roth, teared up in the lobby before the event, moved by the moment. “It’s the first step home — the first of many,” he said. “This is not, ‘Broadway’s back!’ This is ‘Broadway is coming back!’ And we know it can because of this.”,The event, while free, was by invitation only, and the invitations went mostly to workers for two theater industry social service organizations, the , and ,. Among them was a Broadway Cares volunteer, Michael Fatica, who is an actor; he was in the ensemble of “Frozen,” which was the last show at the St. James, and which has announced that it will not reopen on Broadway. “They were fantastic,” he said afterward. “And it’s incredible that people are performing. But it’s so far away from commercial theater, and tens of thousands of actors are still out of work.”,The event was also a chance to bring back the theater’s employees. Tony David, a porter, was there wearing his black suit and a tie and hat with the logo of the Jujamcyn theater organization, plus latex gloves and a face shield over a mask. “It’s nice to be back and doing something,” he said. “Hopefully this is the beginning.”,The event was directed by Jerry Zaks, a four-time Tony winner, who over the years has both acted and directed at the St. James. “This has been the longest I have not been inside a theater in 50 years,” he said. “I don’t want to sound giddy, but I’m excited, and I feel like a kid. There is a pulse — it’s faint, but there is one, and it augurs well for the months ahead.”,The performance was sponsored by ,, which is a partnership among the state government, the producers Scott Rudin and Jane Rosenthal and the artist Zack Winokur. ,, which finances the state’s economic development initiatives, has set aside $5.5 million from its marketing budget to pay for 300 performances through August; the purpose, the state says, is to lift the spirits of New Yorkers and to jump-start the entertainment industry.,The organizers said they would confer on Monday morning about lessons learned from the Saturday event, and they anticipate nine other programs in Broadway houses over the next 10 weeks. But most producers expect that full-scale plays and musicals will not return to Broadway until the fall; commercial theater producers have said they do not believe it is financially feasible to reopen at reduced capacity, and the state is hoping to increase occupancy limits and reduce restrictions over time.,“I don’t have a crystal ball — none of us do, but we have shows scheduled to reopen in September, October and November,” said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League. Ms. St. Martin, who attended the Saturday event, said the Pops Up performances could be helpful steps toward reopening.,“It will give the health department the opportunity to see how the theaters work, and hopefully to learn what it will take for us to be declared OK to open at 100 percent,” she said. “And it’s also a great opportunity to remind us all of what makes New York so special.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/arts/design/warhol-copyright-appeals-court.html,arts,"A few years back, a ,declared that Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 sculpture called “Fountain” — a store-bought urinal he had presented, unchanged, as art — was the most influential work of the 20th century.,Andy Warhol’s 1964 Brillo Boxes — copies of scouring-pad cartons presented as art — could easily have come a close second. The philosopher Arthur Danto built an illustrious career, and a whole school of thought, around the importance of those boxes to understanding the very nature of artworks.,Last month, three federal appellate judges in Manhattan decided they knew more about art than any old critic or philosopher: Whether they quite meant to or not, , had the effect of declaring that the landmark inventions of Duchamp and Warhol — the “appropriation” they practiced, to use the term of art — were not worthy of the legal protection that other creativity is given under copyright law.,The case they were considering arose in 2016 when, after the death of the pop star Prince, the Andy Warhol Foundation for , licensed a 1984 Warhol silk-screen of the musician for use in a magazine’s commemoration. When the photographer , recognized that the Warhol image was based on a photo she had taken ,she asserted that the foundation had infringed on her copyright.,Back in 2019, a trial court decided that Warhol’s use of Goldsmith’s photo was within the bounds of what copyright law calls “fair use.”,“Fair use” is supposed to set guidelines for when one creator is free to borrow from another, without permission or payment. It’s meant to ensure that the same copyright law that protects one artist’s creation doesn’t utterly stymie “the ability of authors, artists, and the rest of us to express them- or ourselves by referencing the works of others,” as the same appeals court in Manhattan once said, in a decision that allowed the fine artist Jeff Koons to appropriate a fashion photo into one of his painting.,Many creative products need to cite other works. Imagine a critic who wants to quote a poem to show how bad it is, or a cartoonist copying a Warhol to make fun of it. Courts have found that this kind of copying is allowed if, among other things, the original work is transformed enough in the process. In other words, even if that cartoon looked quite a lot like the Warhol (it might need to, to work) so long as its goals and functions were quite different from the original, the “transformation” involved would absolve it of copyright infringement.,The court’s blessing as “transformative” is not necessary when an artist manages to get permission to use an image by someone else.,In the Goldsmith case, the original trial court found that in the process of going from her black-and-white photo to Warhol’s colorful silk-screen, the image of Prince had been so transformed that Warhol’s use should count as “fair.”,But the appeals court last month disagreed, ruling that Warhol’s reuse of the Goldsmith had not, in fact, been transformative enough. Any re-user’s work, said the appellate judges, “must reasonably be perceived as embodying an entirely distinct artistic purpose, one that conveys a ‘new meaning or message’ ” — the judges are quoting from an earlier Supreme Court decision — “entirely separate from its source material.”,Fair enough. That’s just what happened when Warhol remade the Brillo company’s boxes: Once presented as art, in a gallery, they certainly had a new purpose and conveyed a new meaning and message compared to identical-looking boxes in a supermarket stockroom.,But then the appeals court sped in the wrong direction, insisting that for reuse to be “fair,” the transformation can’t be so minor that the re-user’s work “remains both recognizably deriving from, and retaining the essential elements of, its source material.” The judges went so far as to hold up collage — “works of art that draw from numerous sources” — as the norm for artistic transformation worthy of the name. Whereas Warhol’s Prince silk-screen, they said, “retains the essential elements of the Goldsmith Photograph without significantly adding to or altering those elements.”,But, in fact, to do truly original artistic work, the reuse often needs to stay very close to its source. Many great modern artists not only don’t “draw from numerous sources” in copying from others, they don’t make any kind of aesthetic change at all to the single image they are copying from.,If Warhol had introduced all sorts of fussy new aesthetics into his boxes, to make them look less like the Brillo originals — if he’d collaged-in some bits of labels from Ivory Soap and Rice Krispies — they would have failed to signify as shockingly important, transformative art. The sameness, the act of “retaining the essential elements” of an extant image, is Warhol’s entire m.o. as one of the most important of all modern artists.,His Campbell’s Soup paintings did not significantly change the company’s soup labels, except for some enlargement; his Marilyn silk-screens did not add a whole lot to 20th Century Fox’s black-and-white headshot of Marilyn Monroe, beyond sometimes adding crude color; ditto for his copies of the Mona Lisa.,The funny thing is that this very same appeals court once came to the aid of one of Warhol’s most faithful disciples,,, when he reused shots of Rastafarians that had originally been taken by the photographer Patrick Cariou. In 2013, , not that different from this one, the appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling that had denied Prince’s fair-use defense. The appeals court declared that, in 25 out of 30 images —-,for instance, where he stuck the head of a dreadlocked Rastafarian onto a picture of another man’s nude body — Prince so transformed the Carious that their copyright was not infringed.,The court was right to come down on Prince’s side, but, to my mind, the decision applied to the wrong batch of Princes: It was the five pictures that didn’t seem quite transformative enough — that left the Carious too much alone — that were actually the works most worth protecting.,That’s because the five works were experimenting with the straight appropriation that Warhol had come up with in the 1960s, and pushing it toward the more expressive, personal styles that have ruled in painting since the 1980s. They couldn’t have done that unless their borrowings from Cariou had been left fairly intact, and identifiable — you might say that by not changing Cariou’s images, they transformed Cariou’s art. His “straight” photography got turned into a jumping-off point for Warholian play.,As transformed by Prince, the five original Carious stop being documentation of Rastas, or even “photographs” per se, but become tokens in a game of “spot the art” that Duchamp’s urinal launched way back in the teens of last century. Prince is underlining how images live in different cultural pigeonholes — for instance as “illustration,” “documentation,” or “fine art” — and showing how appropriation can unsettle us by moving them from one pigeonhole into another.,So in the piece called “Graduation,” one of the five the court decided were not transformative enough in 2013, when Prince takes an electric guitar from some other source and sticks it into the hands of one of Cariou’s Rastafarians, he’s not really saying much about Rastafarians or rock music or guitars. He is saying something about the power that artists have had, since Warhol, to mix and match imagery across cultural boundaries.,Whereas in the 25 works the court embraced as transformative — where Prince fussed a lot with the look of Cariou’s photos — the original images are just raw material for a collage-y result that took off in a completely different direction, aesthetically, but that therefore ended up being a perfectly old-hat, trivial gesture as far as larger art issues are concerned. Frankly, collaging a Rasta head onto a nude,is the kind of thing you might see in a high-school art class. The “transformation” that Prince brought about in those works did not result in any novel creativity worthy of the name., has been driving lawyers and judges crazy since the Supreme Court first introduced it in a 1993 case. It turns out that it’s wildly difficult to figure out when and how function and meaning and message get changed in a culture — which, as far as art is concerned, is just how things should be. Art is all about finding new ways to worry away at precisely such issues. The hitch comes in imagining that courts could ever try to make hard and fast rules about them.,After puzzling through all the options with me, Christopher Sprigman, a lawyer and professor who teaches intellectual property at New York University, just about threw up his hands: Copyright law, he said, “is often very smart but it’s not very deep — and art is just the opposite. When the two things collide, you get problems.”,In current law, Sprigman said, just about all fair-use decisions, or at least all the tricky ones, inevitably involve some kind of “aesthetic theory” — the kind of “theory” that has a court deciding that collage is the way for artists to go. And aesthetic theory is not, to say the least, where judges have the most expertise. People like to quote the words of the great Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: “It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations.”,But Sprigman says that, as things stand, they have no choice.,And if judges have no choice but to consider aesthetics — why one work deserves the right to riff on another, for the sake of our whole culture’s creative life — then they have no choice but to consider which art has mattered most in the past. If, back in the 1960s, a copyright decision had meant that Warhol never got to make his Marilyns — if a court had insisted he collage her face with Kim Novak’s — we’d all be the poorer today. His artistic heirs need to be able to use the appropriation he pioneered and take it to new places, the way the Impressionists took off from the brushwork pioneered by Titian.,There’s a lot that judges can do with the stroke of a pen, but rewriting art history isn’t one of them. They’re stuck with appropriation as one of the great artistic innovations of the modern era. Their job is to make sure the law recognizes that.,Warhol, "

Then, as the Cardinal tried to run out the clock, Aliyah Boston stole the ball with six seconds left, starting a fast break with a clear chance to win. But Brea Beal missed a layup from the left side while running at a full sprint, and Boston missed a short follow-up chance off the back of the rim.,“It was in our hands, but we just came up short,” South Carolina guard Zia Cooke told reporters after the game. She led the Gamecocks with 25 points, including five 3-pointers that were clearly needed to counter Stanford’s aggressive 3-point attack.,At times, especially in the third quarter, Cooke went back and forth with Jones, who scored 24 points for the Cardinal.,The last time the Cardinal were in the national final, they fell to UConn, 53-47, in the Alamodome. Stanford, coached by Tara VanDerveer since 1985, last won the title in 1992.,“To be able to bring us back to this national championship stage is just an honor,” Jones said. “For Tara, for the team, for the program.”,Stanford struggled at the game’s start, committing four turnovers in the first five minutes, but took the lead on a set of free throws by junior guard Lexie Hull at the beginning of the second quarter. By halftime, the Cardinal were up by 6.,As the game developed, both teams began favoring perimeter shots, with Jones and Cooke duking it out as a combination of players — including Cameron Brink and Fran Belibi — worked to keep Boston, South Carolina’s versatile star, from dominating. Boston finished with 11 points, on 5-of-14 shooting, and 16 rebounds.,The teams continued to trade baskets in the middle of the fourth quarter. Stanford maintained a 4-point lead until South Carolina’s Destanni Henderson made a second-chance 3-pointer to bring the Gamecocks within a point. Stanford senior guard Kiana Williams immediately followed up with a jumper in the paint with just over 2 minutes to go. Williams had 8 points for the Cardinal; Henderson had 18 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists for the Gamecocks.,“We really just didn’t have an answer for Cooke or Henderson,” VanDerveer said.,With 39 seconds left, South Carolina was down by 2. Henderson landed a step-back jumper for 3 points, giving the Gamecocks their first lead since the first quarter.,But Jones quickly answered with the shot that ended up being the game-winner.,“We’ll have to play better on Sunday in order to be successful,” VanDerveer said.,Brink, who was managing an injured hamstring, spent much of the game keeping tabs on Boston and South Carolina forward Laeticia Amihere, using her 6-foot-4 frame to knock the ball away down low. Brink had six of Stanford’s 12 blocks; she also had 6 points and 4 rebounds.,Stanford has hit 56 3-pointers over the course of the tournament, breaking the record of 54 set by UConn in 2015.,The teams battled on a court that was new for the Final Four, replacing one of two courts that were used for earlier rounds in the large space that fits a football field in the Alamodome. The setup meant that the court was surrounded on three sides by fans — some cardboard cutout avatars, some human — while the fourth side had a large black curtain to separate the space from the quieter half of the stadium.,Stanford got into gear against South Carolina much earlier than it did in its ,. Cardinal sophomore forward Ashten Prechtel sparked her team in that game, a 78-63 victory, and ended up with 9 points and 8 rebounds in 24 minutes against South Carolina.,Stanford will face Arizona, a fellow member of the Pac-12 and a No. 3 seed, for the national title on Sunday. They played twice during the regular season, the Cardinal winning both times.,“It’s going to just come down to — Sunday — who’s getting after it, who’s most aggressive,” VanDerveer said. “We’ll have to be aggressive.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/theater/mike-daisey-review.html,arts,"Mike Daisey has been a monologuist for more than 20 years. Not continuously — though it has sometimes felt like it.,So his disappearance from the stage during quarantine was an especially vivid marker of the pandemic’s devastating effect on live theater. Likewise, ,, which popped up on Friday night like a bud in early spring, signifies the beginning of a long-hoped-for renewal.,But what will that renewal be like?,On the evidence of the 90-minute monologue Daisey performed in front of an actual audience at the Kraine Theater in the East Village, it will be — at least at first — a hasty and hazy affair with redeeming glints of brilliance.,The haste is to be expected: Daisey was eager to be the first actor back onstage on the first day permitted by new state regulations. ,, when plays, concerts and other performances were allowed to resume at reduced capacity, with the audience masked and distanced. At the 99-seat Kraine, that meant a sellout crowd of 22; to accommodate others — in all, 565 tickets were sold — the show, produced by Daisey and ,, was also livestreamed.,That’s how I saw it; for additional safety, the Kraine requires all in-person audience members to show proof of vaccination, and I have not yet been jabbed. (One unvaccinated couple was turned away.) But even watching remotely, I was tickled by the familiar old sounds of people settling into their seats, and the sight of their heads silhouetted against the blue light of a stage awaiting action.,The show quickly dispelled those good feelings. Daisey has never been what you’d call a feel-good performer; he usually has a beef, and it’s often overcooked. In “,,” his breakthrough, the beef was with Amazon, where he’d once worked. In “,,” it was the corporatization of entertainment that, he argued, had ruined theater as a building block of community. And in “The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,” it was, ,, the Chinese supply chain that feeds our iPhone addiction.,Daisey’s new show lacks the invigorating animus supplied by such adversaries. If it has a beef, it is with the pandemic itself: a foe of little inherent dramatic interest. (,.) At the same time, the pandemic is still too present to be fully fathomed, as Daisey’s title admits with a shrug: “What the Fuck Just Happened?”,It doesn’t help that after an amusing public-address introduction — “The management regrets to inform you that the role of Mike Daisey will be played by Mike Daisey” — he begins, sitting as usual at a simple table with a glass of water and a pad of notes, by telling a seemingly sitcom tale about a bedbug infestation that he and his girlfriend endured in late 2019. Getting rid of the insects involved hiring a company to heat his apartment to 180 degrees for five hours.,The bedbug gambit is ironic; Daisey uses it to suggest how unprepared he and everyone else were for the worse disruptions that would come in 2020. Unfortunately, the “worse” is not fleshed out except in trivial ways that have the effect of deflating yet centering Daisey himself. The apartment in which he and his girlfriend are stuck “in captivity” is so small, he tells us, that he must work on the deck, sometimes in the rain. They have to learn to plan and make their own meals, something people move to New York specifically not to do.,Small talk has rarely seemed smaller. And even as the story grows to include Daisey’s delivering food in the spring, cheering the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the summer and phone banking for the November election — all admirable — he somehow winds up the star in each case. His self-deprecation is only a kind of chamois, polishing his brass.,For a monologuist, that’s a professional hazard. (He calls his calling “an exercise in mansplaining.”) But in previous works, Daisey has managed to use himself as a lens; here he is more of a mirror, reflecting his own obsessions, disappointments and, it has to be said, thin skin. Apparently, he is an underappreciated giant in a world of straw men.,In this self-promoting mode, I find him no more (or less) interesting than an old college chum who corners you at a party and doesn’t notice your eyes glazing over. In his social-critic mode — sniping at obvious targets like Donald J. Trump, , — I find him unexceptional; is it so revealing to refer to the ex-president’s last day in office as “Garbage Day”? As he feels his way through the sweaty dark toward a theme that just isn’t there, you begin to wonder whether his apartment ever cooled off.,But in his oracular mode, which though built on the bedbug story at the start doesn’t arrive until the end, he is outstanding. Connecting Covid-19 not only to ecological disaster but also to the pandemic of racism, he finally aims at antagonists worthy of his rhetorical big guns.,In language that is burnished and implacable — and, it seemed to me, less improvised but more alive than the rest of the show — he says that though the “plague was not a gift” it was an opportunity, a “dress rehearsal.” Noting that there’s “no vaccine for fascism,” he calls for a “refining fire” that will burn out the hate in our system.,These were startling and stirring words, the kind that hogtie your attention. They are worth having Daisey, and live theater, back for. Perhaps by the time he repeats the show, on May 9, there will be less of him and more of them.,Repeated on May 9 at the Kraine Theater, Manhattan; ,."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/arts/television/exterminate-all-the-brutes-raoul-peck.html,arts,"After completing his 2016 documentary “I Am Not Your Negro,” the director Raoul Peck felt he’d had his say on the topic of U.S. race relations. Or at least his subject, the writer James Baldwin, had.,In the film, Baldwin called whiteness a “metaphor for power” and called out this country’s legacy of racism in the bluntest of terms. What more could Peck say that Baldwin hadn’t?,“Baldwin is one of the most precise scholars of American society,” Peck said in a video interview from his home in Paris. “If you didn’t understand the message, that means there is no hope for you.”,The film went on to win over a dozen film awards and an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature. In addition to the accolades and ,, “I Am Not Your Negro” prompted a revival of interest in Baldwin’s work that continues today. In the wake of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, the writer’s work seems as relevant as ever. Even so, said Peck: “I was astonished that people could continue to live their lives as if nothing had happened. As if these words didn’t exist.”,The realization prompted Peck to try to uncover the roots of what Baldwin had written and spoken about so eloquently and passionately: the history of racism, violence and hate in the West. “What was the origin story of all of this?” Peck said he wondered. “Where did the whole ideology of white supremacy begin?”,That search is the focus of Peck’s latest project, “Exterminate All the Brutes,” a supremely ambitious, deeply essayistic undertaking that combines archival footage, clips from Hollywood movies, scripted scenes and animated sequences. Premiering Wednesday on HBO Max, the four-part series charts the history of Western racism, colonialism and genocide, from the Spanish Inquisition and Columbus’s “discovery” of already populated lands, through the stories of the Atlantic slave trade, the massacre at Wounded Knee and the Holocaust.,For Peck, who weaves his own story into the film using voice-over, snapshots and home movies, the project is an intensely personal one. In many ways, he is the ideal person to narrate a tale about western colonialism: After growing up in Haiti, a former colony that won its independence in 1804, he moved at age 8 with his family to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where his parents worked for the newly liberated government. He has also lived and worked in New York, West Berlin and Paris, and has directed films about the Haitian revolution (“Moloch Tropical”) and the assassinated Congolese politician Patrice Lumumba (“Lumumba: Death of a Prophet”).,“I think my soul is somehow Haitian,” he said, “but I’ve been influenced by all the places I’ve been.”,Peck began thinking about “Exterminate” in 2017 after Richard Plepler, then the chairman of HBO, “cursed” him “for 10 minutes” for not bringing “I Am Not Your Negro” to his network, then offered him carte blanche for his next project.,“We’d been working on several film ideas, both documentary and feature film,” said Rémi Grellety, Peck’s producer for the past 13 years. “And Raoul said, ‘Let’s bring Richard the toughest idea.’”,The film, they told Plepler in a two-page pitch, would be based on the historian Sven Lindqvist’s 1992 book “Exterminate All the Brutes,” a mix of history and travelogue that used Joseph Conrad’s novella “Heart of Darkness” as a jumping off point to trace Europe’s racist past in Africa. (“Exterminate all the brutes” are the final words we hear from Kurtz, Conrad’s ivory trading “demigod.”) It would be about that, but also much more, much of which they hadn’t quite worked out yet.,“There were a lot of ideas in that pitch,” Grellety remembered.,After mining Lindqvist’s book, Peck determined he needed a similar text about the history of genocide in the United States. He came upon “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States,” Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz’s American Book Award-winning examination of this country’s centuries-long war against its original inhabitants, and was “wowed.” Peck and Dunbar-Ortiz talked at length about her book and his film, and how the two might come together.,Many of the film’s most powerful scenes derive from Dunbar-Ortiz’s text, including an animated sequence depicting Alexis de Tocqueville’s account of Choctaws crossing the Mississippi in 1831, on what came to be known as the Trail of Tears. When their dogs realize they are being left behind, they “set up a dismal howl,” leaping into the icy waters of the Mississippi in a vain attempt to follow.,“I’m almost crying now, just thinking about it,” Dunbar-Ortiz said. “And in the film, showing it in animation, I think it’ll make a lot of people cry.”,To round out the history, Peck turned to the work of his friend, the Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, who died in 2012. Peck was moved by a central idea in Trouillot’s book “Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History”: that “history is the fruit of power,” shaped and told (or not) by the winners.,“That’s the history of Europe,” Peck said. “Europe got to tell the story for the last 600 years.”,Throughout the series, Peck takes down a succession of sacred cows, including the explorer Henry Morton Stanley (“a murderer”); Winston Churchill, who as a young war correspondent described the slaughter of thousands of Muslim troops at the 1898 Battle of Omdurman as “a splendid game”; and even “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” author, L. Frank Baum, who advocated the extermination of Native Americans after the massacre at Wounded Knee.,Among his most frequent targets is Donald Trump, which the film compares — through a series of powerful juxtapositions — to bigots throughout history. “I am an immigrant from a shithole country,” Peck says at one point, one of several references in the series to Trump’s racist rhetoric.,As a way of creating a “new vehicle to make you feel what the real world is,” Peck said, he filmed several scenes starring Josh Hartnett as a 19th-century U.S. Army officer (loosely based on Quartermaster General Thomas Sidney Jesup), a racist Everyman who reappears throughout history, hanging Black people and shooting Native Americans. Hartnett met Peck years ago on a failed film project, and then later at Cannes, and the two had become friends.,“Last year, he called me and said he wanted a white American actor to play the tip of the genocidal sword of Western history, and he had thought of me,” Hartnett said. “I thought, wow, that’s flattering.”,“I’ve known him for 20 years,” Peck said, “and so I knew I could have that conversation with him.”,In March of last year, Hartnett and the rest of the cast and crew traveled to the Dominican Republic to film the live-action scenes, with locations around the island nation standing in for Florida and the Belgian Congo. Then the pandemic hit, shutting down operations the night before production was due to start. Peck considered his options and moved the entire shoot closer to home.,“We were in the South of France in the summertime,” Hartnett said. “So it wasn’t a bad situation.”,Through meta-textual moments and manipulations, Peck creates his own counterbalance to the dominant Western version of history, forcing viewers to think about the narratives, both popular and academic, they’ve been fed all their lives. In one scene, Hartnett’s character shoots an Indigenous woman (Caisa Ankarsparre), only to have it revealed that she is an actress on a film shoot. In another, a 19th century Anglican cleric gives a lecture dividing humanity into the “savage races” (Africans), the “semicivilized” (Chinese), and the “civilized” — to a contemporary audience filled with people of color.,Early in the series, Peck declares, “There is no such thing as alternative facts.” But he also seems to recognize the selective nature of all historical narrative and the power of controlling the image, probing deeper truths in some scenes by asking viewers to imagine what history might be like if things had gone a different way. In one scene, white families are shackled, whipped and marched through the jungle. In another, Columbus’s landing party is slaughtered on the beaches of present-day Haiti in 1492.,“I’m going to use every means necessary to convey these points,” Peck said.,A longtime filmmaker and film lover, Peck filled his series with movie clips to illustrate Hollywood’s creative reshaping of history (John Wayne in 1960s “The Alamo”) and as a supplement to his arguments. (In a scene played for laughs, Harrison Ford shoots a scimitar-wielding Arab in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”),One of the most disturbing clips in the series — no small feat — is from an otherwise lighthearted Hollywood musical: “On the Town” (1949). In the scene, Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Ann Miller and others cavort through a seemingly docent-free natural history museum, chanting in mock African gibberish, dressing as Indigenous Americans and letting out “war whoops,” and mugging as South Pacific “natives.” Set to the tune “Prehistoric Man,” the dance number conflates a club-toting cave man — “a happy ape with no English drape” — with Native Americans, Africans and Pacific Islanders.,“When I watched it, I said, ‘No, my God, that’s not possible,’” Peck said. “It’s like they knew I was making this film. It just kept giving and giving.”,Not surprisingly, getting rights to some of the clips was a struggle. “We didn’t lie,” Grellety said. “We were contacting people and saying, the title is ‘Exterminate All the Brutes.’ So they knew it wasn’t a romantic comedy.” In some cases, the filmmakers had to secure the clips by invoking fair use — as they did with “Prehistoric Man.”,Peck might not have seen himself reflected in the movies he grew up watching as a young boy in Haiti, but he uses those Hollywood clips to help tell the history of the West anew. This process of imaginative recovery was no accident.,“I was born in a world where I didn’t create everything before me,” he said. “But I can make sure that I take advantage of everything I can to show that the world as you think it is, is not the world as it is.,“And those Hollywood films, those archive folders, those are windows that they didn’t know that they left open.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/arizona-uconn-ncaa.html,sports,"From the very first possession on Friday night, Arizona’s national semifinal game against Connecticut was an exercise in slow, grind-it-out basketball, with a lot of missed shots and long, labored possessions. It was exactly what Arizona wanted.,The Wildcats immediately established their strategy: suffocating defense with the steals to show for it, energetic rebounding and lots of 3-point shots. They pestered the No. 1 seed Huskies possession after possession, racking up a few more fouls than was optimal but ultimately throttling their heavily favored opponent from start to finish to secure a 69-59 victory and their first trip to the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball title game.,“We shocked the world tonight,” said Aari McDonald, a senior whose game-high 26 points seemed to come at exactly the moments the third-seeded Wildcats needed them most. “Keep betting against me and my teammates, we’re going to prove you wrong.”,Arizona, a No. 3 seed, will face top-seeded Stanford in the final on Sunday after derailing UConn, the most dominant program in the tournament’s history, and its heralded freshman, Paige Bueckers.,Instead McDonald took over the stage, hitting two 3-point shots in the first quarter as the team went 6 of 13 on 3-pointers in the first half.,“The first five minutes of the game are crucial,” McDonald said. “Coach Barnes hates it when I take 3s on the first possession, but I was feeling it.”,Adia Barnes, the Arizona coach, had talked about the importance of not being intimidated by UConn’s history.,“To win a championship, all you have to do is beat that team one time,” she had told reporters after her program advanced to its first spot in the Final Four.,The Wildcats had a 32-22 lead at halftime, having held Connecticut to its lowest-scoring half of the season.,The Huskies appeared to be within spitting distance for much of the second half without really sparking a significant comeback. Most of its efforts were led by junior Christyn Williams, who had 12 points in the first half and finished with 20 to lead the Huskies. But Arizona never really let up, and Williams fouled out with less than five minutes to play.,“I think we came out with the wrong mentality,” Williams said. “We thought it was going to be easy, I guess, and we got flustered.”,Anytime the Huskies looked as if they might have a chance to take control, McDonald would hit an impossible-to-ignore circus shot — like the one that she made with Evina Westbrook’s hand directly in front of her face in the second quarter.,“I don’t think we’ve had to play against a guard as good as she is and she proved it tonight,” Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said after the game. “We had no answer for her.”,Whenever Connecticut was on offense, the Wildcats would chant “D up!” over and over. Guards Shaina Pellington and Bendu Yeaney neutralized Bueckers, allowing the guard, who typically scores 20 points per game, just one field goal in the first half. Bueckers, who has averaged 52.4 percent shooting, finished the night with 18 points and shot 38.4 percent, missing eight of her 13 shots.,By the end of the first half, McDonald was running out the clock with the self-assurance of someone who had already won the game, waiting until the last seconds ticked off so she could try to hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer (she missed it).,Connecticut outscored Arizona in the third quarter, but not enough to dig out of the 10-point hole in which they started it.,The teams traded steals and turnovers, continuing their messy, physical game, with Arizona holding the Huskies at a distance while meticulously draining the shot clock on each possession.,At one point, Wildcats guard Helena Pueyo scored with some tricky footwork to bring Connecticut’s deficit to 14 — the Huskies’ largest of the season. Auriemma immediately called a timeout, and Wildcat fans were euphoric.,Arizona’s lead began to gradually shrink in the fourth quarter, as the Wildcats’ shots stopped falling with as much ease as they had earlier in the game. With seven minutes left in the game, though, McDonald hit a fadeaway jumper, giving Arizona a little breathing room once again.,That cycle would repeat itself. With 4 minutes, 23 seconds left, the Wildcats were up 9 points — a lead that seemed fragile, as the team had hit just two of its 10 previous shots and more and more Arizona players got into foul trouble. Barnes took a timeout.,The Wildcats immediately fouled Williams, and she hit both her free throws. But McDonald once again charged through traffic that would have seemed impenetrable for anyone else and wound up at the basket, fighting through contact for the bucket and a 3-point play — and also getting Williams out of the game with her fifth foul. (Video replays appeared to show that she did not touch McDonald on the play.),The clock kept ticking down, and with two minutes left Bueckers hit her fourth field goal to reduce the gap to 7 points. Then it dropped to 6, and with a minute left, just 5 points separated the Huskies from their fourth consecutive Final Four loss. Connecticut started fouling Arizona early, but the Wildcats hit five of their eight free throws in the final minute of the game, and that was enough to seal the win.,“I’ve said all along this year, we have a very immature group,” Auriemma said. “We need to grow up if we expect to be back here in the future.”,Barnes did not seem to entirely agree with that assessment.,“Would I want to face UConn in a seven-game series?” she said. “Absolutely not.”,Now her team will face a fellow member of the Pac-12, a Stanford team that defeated the Wildcats twice this season.,But after taking down Connecticut, Arizona does not seem likely to be intimidated by any opponent.,“We were the underdogs,” McDonald said. “It makes us play harder, everybody thinking we can’t beat these top teams. We’re made for it, like Coach says.”"

A former secretary of state of Georgia who has his own record of decisions that made voting harder for the state’s residents, he is again a key G.O.P. voice leading the charge on the issue.,On Saturday, he repeatedly tried to paint the league’s decision as driven by Stacey Abrams, the voting rights advocate and former Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia who is seen as likely to challenge Mr. Kemp again next year.,Ms. Abrams, one of the most prominent critics of Georgia’s voting law, has pushed back on calls for sports leagues and corporations to boycott the state. She said on Friday that she was “disappointed” baseball officials had pulled the All-Star Game but that she was “proud of their stance on voting rights.”,In defending the law in Georgia, Mr. Kemp singled out two Democratically controlled states, New York and Delaware, and compared their voting regulations with the new law in Georgia. Those states do not offer as many options for early voting as Georgia does, but they have also not passed new laws instituting restrictions on voting.,“In New York, they have 10 days of early voting,” Mr. Kemp said (New York ,). “In Georgia, we have a minimum of 17, with two additional Sundays that are optional in our state. In New York, you have to have an excuse to vote absentee. In Georgia, you can vote absentee for any reason.”,Mr. Kemp’s news conference followed a week of television appearances in which he has staunchly defended the law, arguing that it expands access to voting because of an extra required Saturday of early voting. He and other Republicans have denounced criticism of the law as a political game by state and national Democratic leaders. (The New York Times reviewed the voting law and , that could hamper voting access or the nonpartisan administration of elections.),The decision to move the All-Star Game was the first major statement by a leading organization or business since Georgia passed its voting law, and came amid a growing chorus of corporate statements denouncing the legislation after it had already been signed.,Delta and Coca-Cola, two of the state’s largest corporations, ,, stating sternly that they were against the law.,“I want to be crystal clear,” James Quincey, the chief executive of Coca-Cola, said on Wednesday. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.”,Big companies and Major League Baseball had ,, , and faith leaders who wanted to see important American institutions take a stronger stance against the voting law in Georgia, as well as similar Republican efforts now advancing in states around the country.,In response to the companies that have spoken out, Republicans including Mr. Trump have called for a boycott. “Don’t go back to their products until they relent,” the former president urged in a statement on Saturday night, naming companies including Delta and Coca-Cola. “We can play the game better than them.” ,Mr. Kemp challenged Major League Baseball to consider what it might do if the Atlanta Braves made the playoffs.,“What are they going to do if the Braves make the playoffs?” he said. “Are they going to move the damn playoff game?”,And he said that more event changes or boycotts would not prompt him to reconsider the law or support any adjustments to it.,Promising that he was “not wavering,” Mr. Kemp said, “For anybody that’s out there thinking that any kind of snowball effect is going to have an effect on me, it will not.”"

His 2019 season ended that May 1 when hit on the forearm by a comebacker, and his debut for Texas in the 2020 season lasted just one inning when he tore a muscle in his right shoulder on July 26.,Winner of the 2014 and 2017 Cy Young awards for Cleveland, Kluber is a right-hander who turns 35 next Saturday and is seeking to re-establish himself with the Yankees, who gave him an $11 million, one-year deal. He struggled with his control, allowing three walks, five hits and costly wild pitch in four-plus innings with five strikeouts. The Yankees’ defense helped him by turning double plays in the first two innings.,Called “Klubot” for his reserved, robot-like manner, he is among three Yankees starters coming off long layoffs.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-tournament-final-stanford-arizona.html,sports,"SAN ANTONIO — For the first time, two teams from the Pac-12 will fight for the national title in the N.C.A.A. women’s tournament final as top-seeded Stanford faces Arizona, a No. 3 seed.,Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer likes the idea of the all-Pac-12 matchup.,“That would be awesome,” she said after Stanford squeezed past South Carolina in a tight semifinal battle for its spot in the title game. “We’re rooting for Arizona. It would be really exciting, it’s just I think a credit to how competitive the Pac-12 is.”,She is no longer rooting for Arizona, which stunned top-seeded UConn, 69-59, in the national semifinals on Friday night.,Only six prior N.C.A.A. women’s title games have featured teams within the same conference: Three were between Southeastern Conference teams, two were within the Big East and one was in the Atlantic Coast Conference.,Stanford made it into the final by the skin of its teeth, defeating South Carolina, 66-65, then watched Arizona reach its first national-title game in program history.,“I’ve been saying all along: Pac-12 is the best conference in the country, hands down,” Arizona Coach Adia Barnes said after the Wildcats routed the Huskies. “I think this is proof of it. Stanford won the Pac-12, we were second, and we’re playing for a national championship.”,In the championship game, Stanford will seek its third title while Arizona will pursue its first. The final starts at 6 p.m. Eastern time, and will be televised on ESPN.,Here are a few things to follow:,Both of these teams employ a lot of ball pressure and have the length to cover the floor.,Stanford and Arizona are the best in the Pac-12 ,. Arizona held UConn, with its typically high-octane offense, to its lowest-scoring game of the season in the national semifinals. Stanford has been protecting the rim with a combination of Cameron Brink, Fran Belibi and Anna Wilson.,“Usually defensively one of our strengths is our guard defense,” VanDerveer said. “Anna Wilson has been a lockdown defender for us all year.”,And neither team is afraid to foul or be fouled.,“Trapping Aari is very difficult,” Barnes said of Arizona’s leading contributor on Friday, Aari McDonald. “I think she did a good job of drawing fouls. Aari got fouled nine times in the game.”,The Pac-12 player of the year has owned the Alamodome’s floors, scoring at least 26 points in each of the past three games. She is lithe yet powerful, cutting through defenses and outrunning those who try to contain her.,While she is often most effective when penetrating defenses, she is also dangerous from the outside: McDonald has been shooting almost 42 percent from beyond the arc in the postseason.,And she is a formidable defender, often stealing the ball and converting turnovers into points. She has also had more than five defensive rebounds in each of the past four games.,“She’s really underrated on defense,” Barnes said after the national semifinal. “I thought in my mind she should have been the national defensive Player of the Year. There was no other player that impacts the game on both ends of the floor more.”,With solid defenders congesting the paint, it is a good thing neither team fears shooting from outside.,Though it has taken Arizona a bit longer to get comfortable shooting from deep, the Wildcats have landed 42 3-pointers in this tournament, shooting 34 percent. Stanford set a record in its win over South Carolina for made 3-pointers in the tournament with 56. UConn set the previous record of 54 in 2015. The Cardinal were 5 of 8 on 3-pointers on Friday night.,And Stanford has plenty of players who can shoot: Kiana Williams is one of the Cardinal’s most reliable shooters, landing a 3-pointer in every game she had played since early January until Friday night. Despite that lapse, leading scorers Haley Jones and Lexie Hull were perfect on 3-point shots.,“My teammates see me shoot at practice, I feel confident,” Jones said in a postgame interview on Friday. “They just kind of instill their confidence in me when I don’t have it in myself.”,Though Stanford has prevailed in two previous matchups with Arizona this season, Barnes is unafraid after coming this far.,“They’ve beat us twice this year: They have to beat us a third time,” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/gonzaga-ucla-final-four-buzzer-beater.html,sports,"INDIANAPOLIS — As , made its way through this pandemic season, with its stops and starts and tenor of uncertainty, it eyed an opportunity to stamp the season with a different sort of historical marker — an unbeaten season.,Since the start, when they began the season as the top-ranked team in the country, the Zags rolled over every obstacle put in their path, a scintillating offense eviscerating every opponent and showing almost no signs of vulnerability during their nearly three-week stay here for the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament.,Then late Saturday night, the Zags did what they hadn’t had to do all season — survive.,And they did so in spectacular fashion, with Jalen Suggs banking in a 40-footer at the buzzer to give Gonzaga a 93-90 overtime victory over U.C.L.A. in a national semifinal at Lucas Oil Stadium.,Suggs’ shot, with two Bruins in front of him, came after Johnny Juzang had erased the last of a 5-point deficit in the final minute of the extra period by following his own miss, the last of his game-high 29 points. Suggs took the inbound pass from Corey Kispert and after a couple dribbles launched his shot from just past midcourt.,As it went through, Suggs raced across the court from the Gonzaga bench, leapt atop a table and thrust his fists in the air as his teammates gave chase. Meanwhile on the court, the Bruins stood in disbelief, hands on their heads or the hips. As Gonzaga Coach Mark Few walked to midcourt to shake hands with Mick Cronin, his counterpart, all he could do was hold his arms out and shrug before the two embraced.,“I was just thinking, ‘please, please go in,’ I don’t want to go to another overtime,” Suggs said.,The shot is sure to be a defining moment in tournament history, the way , and the way ,, when his halfcourt heave came within a kind bounce of giving Butler the title here in Indianapolis.,“It’s crazy,” Suggs said. “Again, like I said, to actually live out that moment — oh, my gosh. Right now, I’m tripping. I still don’t believe it. It’s not going to kick in until the morning.”,Perhaps then it will be time to look ahead. Gonzaga, which is 31-0, advances to play Baylor on Monday night — a matchup between the two best teams in the country for most of the season and a redux of their scheduled matchup in Indianapolis in early December that was wiped out 90 minutes before tipoff because of positive coronavirus tests within the Bears’ traveling party.,The game will have a hard time being as riveting as the Bulldogs’ win over the 11th-seeded Bruins, who entered the game as two-touchdown underdogs, the biggest spread in a Final Four game in 25 years. The Bulldogs will be attempting to become the first team since 1976 to win a championship with an undefeated season. Two teams had reached the semifinals unbeaten since Indiana, but that’s where runs ended for Nevada-Las Vegas in 1991, when it was shocked by Duke, and Kentucky in 2015, when it went down to Wisconsin.,Gonzaga had looked just as formidable all season as those U.N.L.V. and Kentucky teams, which were stocked with future pros. The Zags had only one game closer than double digits — back in early December — and they had rolled into the Final Four with victories by 43, 16, 18 and 19 points.,Coach after coach who looked at Gonzaga’s film came away with a sobering assessment: they were the best passing team they’d ever seen in college basketball. Center Drew Timme was lethal around the basket and if teams dared double team him, he was an able passer and soon the ball was buzzing around the perimeter until the desired result was achieved: a layup or an uncontested 3-pointer.,But the Zags nearly met their match in the Bruins, who with their rich basketball history and record 11 men’s national championships, were in the unaccustomed role of long shots.,U.C.L.A. entered the tournament on a four-game losing skid, and had to first get through a play-in game against Michigan State, which it beat in overtime to reach the round of 64. The Bruins then upset second-seeded Alabama, again in overtime, and knocked off top-seeded Michigan with a late defensive stand.,They nearly pulled off their biggest shocker on Saturday night.,Cronin had three objectives: keep the pace controlled, minimize turnovers that would fuel Gonzaga’s fast break and play the same unyielding defense that had gotten them to this point. They executed almost perfectly — and were urged on by a contingent of U.C.L.A fans that included two members of their last title team in 1995: Tyus Edney and Toby Bailey.,It made for tense, riveting theater almost from the opening tip-off — with 15 ties and 19 lead changes — and only got more dramatic as the night wore on.,“We might not have been the best team in the country all year, but we became one of the best four teams in the country, period,” Cronin said. “This was not a fluke tonight. We would not have gotten blown out Monday night. We didn’t sneak in.”,If Suggs won the game with his long shot, he may have saved it with his defense, preventing U.C.L.A from taking the lead late in regulation when he swooped in to block U.C.L.A. center Cody Riley’s shot at the rim inside the final minute.,The Bruins did have a chance to win it as their star, Juzang, who played the entire game, wound his way through the Gonzaga defense in the final seconds of regulation. But he was whistled for charging into center Drew Timme when he landed in a heap among a trio of Zags under the basket with 1.1 seconds left.,“I would say this, it’s the hardest play in the world for an official,” Cronin said. “And if I see the film and it looked like the guy was moving, then sometimes things aren’t meant to be.”,The call not only prevented Juzang, a 90-percent free-throw shooter, from going to the line; it kept Timme, who picked up his fourth foul with 4 minutes, 41 seconds left in regulation, in the game.,Timme, who finished with 25 points, scored Gonzaga’s first 6 points of the extra period to put the Bulldogs ahead, 87-83.,U.C.L.A. drew closer when Riley, after Tyger Campbell drew the defense, sank a baseline jumper, and it had a chance to tie on its next possession but Juzang missed a short transition floater with 1 minute, 38 seconds remaining in overtime. Andrew Nembhard seemed to put Gonzaga in control when he knocked in a 3-pointer less than 30 seconds later to put Gonzaga ahead by 90-85.,But the Bruins, as they have done all tournament, had an answer. Coming out of a timeout, Jaquez, who had 19 points, knocked in a 3-pointer from the wing to draw the Bruins within 90-88 with 48 seconds left. When Kispert missed a 3-pointer, the Bruins hustled into the frontcourt and put the ball in the hands of their best player, Juzang, who drove into the lane and missed a short jumper, but collected the rebound and put it back in.,The Zags’ undoing in years past has often been talented opponents with a physical, relentless defense. On nights when their free-flowing offense couldn’t escape the muck, they have rarely had the type of defense that could win those types of games. It is what undid Gonzaga in their last tournament appearance two years ago, when as a No. 1 seed they were upset by Texas Tech in the West regional final.,This year, Few insisted, was different.,The Zags, analytically at least, rated as among the nation’s best defenses and in Suggs, a freshman, they had what has for them been a rare player — an elite athlete with a football player’s mentality. The problem against the Bruins is that there was only one of him. U.C.L.A. was able to isolate Juzang on whoever was guarding him or let Cody Riley, the Bruins’ bulky left-handed center, draw Timme out of the paint and shoot jumpers over him. They also picked on Kispert, who was a defensive millstone.,Yet, when it mattered most for Gonzaga, it wasn’t the defense that saved its season. It was a prayer from the heavens."

But Arizona guard Aari McDonald, who had scored the most points by any player in the tournament before Sunday’s game, started beating Stanford’s defenses and closed Arizona’s deficit to 1 on a step-back jumper with 3 minutes, 35 seconds left.,Stanford’s Haley Jones, whose game-winning shot helped the Cardinal defeat top-seeded South Carolina in the Final Four and who led them with 17 points Sunday, added a free throw to offer the Cardinal a cushion, but McDonald was hot. She got closer with a free throw, then had a final opportunity after Stanford turned it over on a shot clock violation with less than 6 seconds left.,Her last-second jumper, a turnaround heave as she was swarmed by three Cardinal defenders, bounced off the back of the rim as time expired, delivering the Cardinal their third title in program history.,The battle between the teams that topped the Pac-12 Conference, then outlasted 62 others in the N.C.A.A. tournament, echoed the unusual circumstances of the tournament itself. Traditional powers like No. 1-seeded UConn and South Carolina and No. 2-seeded Baylor found themselves watching the title game from afar, and the field of 64 carried more teams that had a legitimate chance to win it all. They played against the backdrop of the public health crisis and questions about the stature of women’s basketball in an embattled college sports industry. But through it all, Stanford was considered one of the sport’s top teams and solidified that claim with its championship.,“We’re excited to win the Covid championship,” Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said in an interview on ESPN after the game.,The title game brought together Pac-12 rivals for the first time. It also featured one of the few Black coaches ever to reach the title game in a sport where more than ,. The tournament itself, a three-week bonanza running concurrently with the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament ,, became a forum for conversation about the ,.,It all played in front of a crowd that was equal parts cardboard cutouts and mask-wearing humans amid a pandemic that shuttered most large-scale in-person events over the last year.,The win was Stanford’s first national title since 1992 — all have been won with VanDerveer, who started coaching the Cardinal in 1985 and became the ,season. In accordance with the pandemic’s ambience, she celebrated passing the longtime Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt on the career wins list with just her team and staff in a practically barren stadium 80 miles northeast of Stanford’s campus while local health restrictions prohibited them from playing at home.,The tournament, centered in San Antonio as a means to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, was not easy for Stanford even before the final game. It was almost knocked out by , and ,.,But Stanford had to overcome much more this season, living as nomads for over two months while Santa Clara County, Calif., prohibited contact sports in November. Out of options, the Cardinal started practicing in Las Vegas, living out of hotels and playing home games in the beach town of Santa Cruz, a 45-mile trek along a windy road — worlds away from the Silicon Valley school.,“I don’t think any other team in this tournament had to live out of a suitcase, live out of a hotel for 10 weeks during the season,” Stanford’s Kiana Williams, a senior guard from San Antonio, said in a postgame interview. “We had to do that because that’s how bad we wanted to play.”,When they were able to play in their home arena again in February, athletes were isolated to their apartments at the outskirts of their training facilities, attending virtual classes and video chatting with loved ones as their only means to connect with people outside of their sports bubble.,The Cardinal , that saw them play mostly in-conference opponents, and they won both the Pac-12 tournament and regular season title. VanDerveer told reporters before the game that the conference’s strength warmed them up for the national stage. The league had four top-25 schools right before the tournament.,“Playing in the Pac-12, we got better as they got better,” VanDerveer said in a postgame interview.,Stanford beat Arizona twice this season, winning by 27 points in January and by 14 to win the regular-season title. Through previous matchups and lessons learned from Arizona’s tournament run, Stanford determined the key to winning was to suppress ,, who led her team to the final by scoring 26 points against UConn in the national semifinals. This was her 93rd consecutive game with double-digit scoring, the longest active streak in women’s college basketball. Redshirt senior Anna Wilson, the younger sister of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, and freshman Cameron Brink had her locked down for significant portions of the game.,McDonald, the Pac-12 player of the year, fought her way through Stanford’s defense to earn 22 points on 5 of 20 shooting from the field and 4 of 9 from 3-point range.,“Aari, hands down, no doubt, is the best player in Arizona’s history,” Arizona Coach Adia Barnes said in a postgame interview.,The matchup with Arizona marked the first time that two Pac-12 teams faced each other in the finals; out of six in-conference championships for the national title, three were between Southeastern Conference teams, two were within the Big East and one was in the Atlantic Coast Conference.,The last time the Cardinal played in the national championship — 2010 in the Alamodome, when it fell to UConn — was the last time that a Pac-12 team did as well. At that point, the league was still the Pac-10, and Stanford was largely the national face of it. Since welcoming the University of Utah and University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2011, Pac-12 teams emerged as a staple of the women’s Final Four with appearances by Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford.,“It means that the Pac-12 is the best conference in the country,” Barnes said. “Start paying attention,” she added, “we have some of the best players in the country.”,Barnes, meanwhile, was fighting to become the third Black female coach to claim the N.C.A.A. title. She is one of five Black women to have coached in a women’s Final Four, following in the footsteps of C. Vivian Stringer, Carolyn Peck, Pokey Chatman and Dawn Staley; the national semifinals this year was the first time that two Black head coaches led teams simultaneously.,“We came within a basket of winning a national championship,” Barnes said. “I’m proud.”,This win marks an end to the teams’ stay in San Antonio, a controlled environment that offered a clear view of disparities between the men’s and women’s tournaments.,That, too, came into focus because of the virus.,VanDerveer said in an interview on Thursday that she did not think the inequities in the sport would have made the spotlight without the , and facilities for the athletes.,“Covid has exacerbated everything,” VanDerveer said in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday. “It has challenged us in ways we were really maybe unprepared for.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/golf/golf-augusta-women-amateur.html,sports,"AUGUSTA, Ga. — The first Augusta National Women’s Amateur in 2019 featured a closing charge by the eventual winner, Jennifer Kupcho, who faced down the intimidating back nine by playing her final six holes in five under par.,While the tournament was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s edition proved, like so many of the Masters tournaments, that Augusta National is often the setting for drama and unpredictable outcomes.,For most of Saturday’s final round, it appeared that Rose Zhang, a 17-year-old Californian, was going to claim a narrow victory in the 54-hole event with her steady, poised play. Zhang, who began the day tied for the lead after the first two rounds at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club, suddenly stumbled on Saturday with a triple bogey on the treacherous 13th hole. But Zhang then rallied to become one of six golfers tied for the lead with only a handful of holes left to play.,For the next hour, the players jockeyed for the lead on the famed Augusta National layout in familiar, if fickle, ways — stunning recoveries under pressure, deft short-game play, steely-eyed putts and the occasional flub.,In a surprise ending, after a one-hole playoff, it was a different 17-year-old, Tsubasa Kajitani of Japan, who came from behind to win the tournament. No Asian player has won the Masters, which was first contested in 1934. Asked how it felt to be the first player from Japan to win a tournament at Augusta National, Kajitani, who came off the final green with tears running down her cheeks, said through an interpreter that it was “a dream come true.”,After 18 holes on Saturday, Kajitani and Emilia Migliaccio, a senior and an all-American golfer at Wake Forest University, were tied at one over par, one stroke ahead of six players from five countries who tied at two over.,Both players hit their tee shots into the 18th fairway to start the playoff, but each was slightly out of position after wayward approach shots. Migliaccio had an exceedingly difficult chip over a bunker to a green sloping away from her, and Kajitani had to putt down the same unnerving slope from 45 feet away. Kajitani’s task proved less daunting, although she had to sink a 5-foot par putt to clinch her victory.,Kajitani, who is from Okayama, Japan, did not play in the , in 2019 at Augusta National, although she won the Japan Junior Championship that year. She was second at the 2019 Australian Women’s Amateur and played in three other events on the LPGA of Japan Tour.,“I have played in many other tournaments,” Kajitani said. “But you can’t really compare those to this tournament.”,Migliaccio played Saturday with her mother, Ulrika, who was a top collegiate golfer at the University of Arizona, acting as her caddie, making the duo the first mother-daughter pair to compete at Augusta National. That partnership made the closing round especially memorable for Migliaccio, who has decided not to pursue a professional golf career.,“It was so fun; it was so special,” Migliaccio said Saturday evening. “That’s all I wanted to do. I really wanted to enjoy this moment with my mom, and this is probably one of the last times she’s going to caddie for me, and it was just a joy to be out there.”,She added: “I’m not going to turn professional and I’m really happy with my decision. Golf has taken me so far. It’s allowed me to played Augusta National, which I wouldn’t have dreamed of when I started playing.”,After starting Saturday’s round two strokes off the lead, Kajitani appeared to have botched her chance at winning when she needed four strokes from the front of the 17th green to get her ball in the hole for a double bogey. Kajitani conceded that she had hit two nervous shots at the 17th hole, but she then turned her focus to the closing hole.,Kajitani, who hit 79 percent of her tee shots in the fairway during the tournament, found a bunker on the left side of the fairway on the 18th hole. An attempt to hit a challenging uphill shot to the green came up considerably short. But her pitch from about 50 yards nearly spun back into the hole for birdie. A sturdy par was enough get her into the playoff with Migliaccio.,Zhang, who began the final round tied with Ingrid Lindblad of Sweden, was comfortably in the lead at one under until a series of mishaps at the 13th hole, where she had to take two penalty strokes for errant shots. The trouble began when Zhang hooked her tee shot toward the hazard on the left side of the hole. When the ball was not found, Zhang had to hit a second shot from the 13th tee. Her fourth shot on the hole ended up in the water hazard protecting the green. After chipping onto the green, she two-putted for a triple bogey.,Zhang recovered with a birdie on the 14th hole to rejoin the gaggle in the lead, although a bogey at the 17th ultimately left her one stroke behind Kajitani and Migliaccio. Still, she was pleased.,“To handle the pressure of just being on television and playing at Augusta National, I think says a lot,” Zhang said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/health/hexapro-mclellan-vaccine.html,business,"A new vaccine for , that is entering clinical trials in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam could change how the world fights the pandemic. The vaccine, called NVD-HXP-S, is the first in clinical trials to use a new molecular design that is widely expected to create more potent antibodies than the current generation of vaccines. And the new vaccine could be far easier to make.,Existing , from companies like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson must be produced in specialized factories using hard-to-acquire ingredients. In contrast, the new vaccine can be mass-produced in chicken eggs — the same eggs that produce billions of influenza vaccines every year in factories around the world.,If NVD-HXP-S proves safe and effective, flu vaccine manufacturers could potentially produce well over a billion doses of it a year. Low- and middle-income countries , from wealthier countries may be able to make NVD-HXP-S for themselves or acquire it at low cost from neighbors.,“That’s staggering — it would be a game-changer,” said Andrea Taylor, assistant director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center.,First, however, clinical trials must establish that NVD-HXP-S actually works in people. The first phase of clinical trials will conclude in July, and the final phase will take several months more. But experiments with vaccinated animals have raised hopes for the vaccine’s prospects.,“It’s a home run for protection,” said Dr. Bruce Innes of the PATH Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access, which has coordinated the development of NVD-HXP-S. “I think it’s a world-class vaccine.”, by acquainting the immune system with a virus well enough to prompt a defense against it. Some vaccines contain entire viruses that have been killed; others contain just a single protein from the virus. Still others contain genetic instructions that our cells can use to make the viral protein.,Once exposed to a virus, or part of it, the immune system can learn to make antibodies that attack it. Immune cells can also learn to recognize infected cells and destroy them.,In the case of the coronavirus, the best target for the immune system is the protein that covers its surface like a crown. The protein, known as ,, latches onto cells and then allows the virus to fuse to them.,But simply injecting coronavirus spike proteins into people is not the best way to vaccinate them. That’s because spike proteins sometimes assume the wrong shape, and prompt the immune system to make the wrong antibodies.,This insight emerged long before the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2015, another coronavirus appeared, causing a deadly form of pneumonia called MERS. Jason McLellan, a structural biologist then at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, and his colleagues set out to make a vaccine against it.,They wanted to use the spike protein as a target. But they had to reckon with the fact that the spike protein is a shape-shifter. As the protein prepares to fuse to a cell, it contorts from a tulip-like shape into something more akin to a javelin.,Scientists call these two shapes the prefusion and postfusion forms of the spike. Antibodies against the prefusion shape work powerfully against the coronavirus, but postfusion antibodies don’t stop it.,Dr. McLellan and his colleagues used standard techniques to make a MERS vaccine but ended up with a lot of postfusion spikes, useless for their purposes. Then they discovered a way to keep the protein locked in a tulip-like prefusion shape. All they had to do was change two of more than 1,000 building blocks in the protein into a compound called proline.,The resulting spike — called 2P, for the two new proline molecules it contained — was far more likely to assume the desired tulip shape. , and found that the animals could easily fight off infections of the MERS coronavirus.,The team filed a patent for its modified spike, but the world took little notice of the invention. MERS, although deadly, is not very contagious and proved to be a relatively minor threat; fewer than 1,000 people have died of MERS since it first emerged in humans.,But in late 2019 a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged and began ravaging the world. Dr. McLellan and his colleagues swung into action, designing a 2P spike unique to SARS-CoV-2. In a matter of days, Moderna used that information to design a vaccine for Covid-19; it contained a genetic molecule called RNA with the instructions for making the 2P spike.,Other companies soon followed suit, adopting 2P spikes for their own vaccine designs and starting clinical trials. All three of the vaccines that have been authorized so far in the United States — from Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech — use the 2P spike.,Other vaccine makers are using it as well. , has had strong results with the 2P spike in clinical trials and is expected to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization in the next few weeks. , is also testing a 2P spike vaccine and expects to finish clinical trials later this year.,Dr. McLellan’s ability to find lifesaving clues in the structure of proteins has earned him deep admiration in the vaccine world. “This guy is a genius,” said Harry Kleanthous, a senior program officer at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “He should be proud of this huge thing he’s done for humanity.”,But once Dr. McLellan and his colleagues handed off the 2P spike to vaccine makers, he turned back to the protein for a closer look. If swapping just two prolines improved a vaccine, surely additional tweaks could improve it even more.,“It made sense to try to have a better vaccine,” said Dr. McLellan, who is now an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin.,In March, he joined forces with two fellow University of Texas biologists, Ilya Finkelstein and Jennifer Maynard. Their three labs created 100 new spikes, each with an altered building block. With funding from the Gates Foundation, they tested each one and then combined the promising changes in new spikes. Eventually, they created a single protein that met their aspirations.,The winner contained the two prolines in the 2P spike, plus four additional prolines found elsewhere in the protein. Dr. McLellan called the new spike,, in honor of its total of six prolines.,The structure of HexaPro was even more stable than 2P, the team found. It was also resilient, better able to withstand heat and damaging chemicals. Dr. McLellan hoped that its rugged design would make it potent in a vaccine.,Dr. McLellan also hoped that HexaPro-based vaccines would reach more of the world — especially low- and middle-income countries, which so far have received only a fraction of the total distribution of first-wave vaccines.,“The share of the vaccines they’ve received so far is terrible,” Dr. McLellan said.,To that end, the University of Texas set up a licensing arrangement for HexaPro that allows companies and labs in 80 low- and middle-income countries to use the protein in their vaccines without paying royalties.,Meanwhile, Dr. Innes and his colleagues at PATH were looking for a way to increase the production of Covid-19 vaccines. They wanted a vaccine that less wealthy nations could make on their own.,The first wave of authorized Covid-19 vaccines require specialized, costly ingredients to make. Moderna’s RNA-based vaccine, for instance, needs genetic building blocks called nucleotides, as well as a custom-made fatty acid to build a bubble around them. Those ingredients must be assembled into vaccines in purpose-built factories.,The way influenza vaccines are made is a study in contrast. Many countries have huge factories for making cheap flu shots, with influenza viruses injected into chicken eggs. The eggs produce an abundance of new copies of the viruses. Factory workers then extract the viruses, weaken or kill them and then put them into vaccines.,The PATH team wondered if scientists could make a Covid-19 vaccine that could be grown cheaply in chicken eggs. That way, the same factories that make flu shots could make Covid-19 shots as well.,In New York, a team of scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai knew how to make just such a vaccine, using a bird virus called Newcastle disease virus that is harmless in humans.,For years, scientists had been , to create vaccines for a range of diseases. To develop an Ebola vaccine, for example, researchers added an Ebola gene to the Newcastle disease virus’s own set of genes.,The scientists then inserted the engineered virus into chicken eggs. Because it is a bird virus, it multiplied quickly in the eggs. The researchers ended up with Newcastle disease viruses coated with Ebola proteins.,At Mount Sinai, the researchers set out to do the same thing, using coronavirus spike proteins instead of Ebola proteins. When they learned about Dr. McLellan’s new HexaPro version, they added that to the Newcastle disease viruses. The viruses bristled with spike proteins, many of which had the desired prefusion shape. In a nod to both the Newcastle disease virus and the HexaPro spike, they called it NDV-HXP-S.,PATH arranged for thousands of doses of NDV-HXP-S to be produced in a Vietnamese factory that normally makes influenza vaccines in chicken eggs. In October, the factory sent the vaccines to New York to be tested. The Mount Sinai researchers found that NDV-HXP-S conferred powerful protection in mice and hamsters.,“I can honestly say I can protect every hamster, every mouse in the world against SARS-CoV-2,” Dr. Peter Palese, the leader of the research, said. “But the jury’s still out about what it does in humans.”,The potency of the vaccine brought an extra benefit: The researchers needed fewer viruses for an effective dose. A single egg may yield five to 10 doses of NDV-HXP-S, compared to one or two doses of influenza vaccines.,“We are very excited about this, because we think it’s a way of making a cheap vaccine,” Dr. Palese said.,PATH then connected the Mount Sinai team with influenza vaccine makers. On March 15, Vietnam’s Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals , the start of a clinical trial of NDV-HXP-S. A week later, Thailand’s Government Pharmaceutical Organization ,. On March 26, Brazil’s Butantan Institute , it would ask for authorization to begin its own clinical trials of NDV-HXP-S.,Meanwhile, the Mount Sinai team has also , the vaccine to the Mexican vaccine maker Avi-Mex as an intranasal spray. The company will start clinical trials to see if the vaccine is even more potent in that form.,To the nations involved, the prospect of making the vaccines entirely on their own was appealing. “This vaccine production is produced by Thai people for Thai people,” Thailand’s health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said at the announcement in Bangkok.,In Brazil, the Butantan Institute trumpeted its version of NDV-HXP-S as “the Brazilian vaccine,” one that would be “produced entirely in Brazil, without depending on imports.”,Ms. Taylor, of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, was sympathetic. “I could understand why that would really be such an attractive prospect,” she said. “They’ve been at the mercy of global supply chains.”,Madhavi Sunder, an expert on intellectual property at Georgetown Law School, cautioned that NDV-HXP-S would not immediately help countries like Brazil as they grappled with the current wave of Covid-19 infections. “We’re not talking 16 billion doses in 2020,” she said.,Instead, the strategy will be important for long-term vaccine production — not just for Covid-19 but for other pandemics that may come in the future. “It sounds super promising,” she said.,In the meantime, Dr. McLellan has returned to the molecular drawing board to try to make a third version of their spike that is even better than HexaPro.,“There’s really no end to this process,” he said. “The number of permutations is almost infinite. At some point, you’d have to say, ‘This is the next generation.’”"

Now September is the new goal that many companies have marked on the calendar for bringing back office workers who have been working remotely for the past year.,Maybe. Companies are wary of setting hard deadlines, recent reporting by , found. Some corporations are reopening offices in the spring, while many are saying they will remain flexible, will stage returns over several months and will allow some workers to continue to work from home for a few days a week or more. As nerve-racking as it was for people last year to be abruptly torn from their desks, many people find the prospect of returning distressing.,Here is what some of the country’s biggest companies are telling workers.,Ford, which has more than 30,000 employees in the United States working remotely because of the pandemic, said in March that it would transition to a “flexible hybrid work model.” The company plans to let people stay home for focused work and come into the office for activities that require teamwork. The new protocol will start in July, when the company, which has its main campus in Dearborn, Mich., expects to gradually start bringing more employees back.,IBM, which employs about 346,000 people, hasn’t set a strict timeline for when its U.S. workers will return to the office. It expects about 80 percent of its employees to work with some combination of remote and office schedules, depending largely on role.,The bank, which has more than 20,000 office employees in New York City, has told employees that the five-day office workweek is a relic. It is considering a rotational work model, meaning employees would switch between working remotely and in the office.,The consulting firm formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has about 284,000 employees, is set to open one office in each of its major cities in May and all of its offices in September. Even when the offices are formally reopened, PwC will allow some workers, depending on their job, to work remotely at least part time.,Most of Walmart’s 1.5 million employees work at the retail giant’s stores, and a vast number have continued to go into work throughout the pandemic. It said on March 12 that it would start bringing workers back at its Bentonville, Ark., office campus no earlier than July. Its global technology employees will continue to work virtually “for the long-term.”,At Wells Fargo, 60,000 employees worked at bank branches and other facilities during the pandemic, but 200,000 more worked remotely. The company told its staff in a memo last month that it had set a Sept. 6 return-to-office target and was “optimistic” that conditions surrounding Covid-19 vaccinations and case levels would allow it to keep it."

Yellen made the case on Monday for a global minimum tax, kicking off the Biden administration’s effort to help raise revenue in the United States and prevent companies from shifting profits overseas to evade taxes.,Ms. Yellen, in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, called for global coordination on an international tax rate that would apply to multinational corporations regardless of where they locate their headquarters. Such a global tax could help prevent the type of “race to the bottom” that has been underway, Ms. Yellen said, referring to countries trying to outdo one another by lowering tax rates in order to attract business.,Her remarks came as the White House and Democrats in Congress begin looking for ways to pay for , to rebuild America's roads, bridges, water systems and electric grid.,“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” Ms. Yellen said. “It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.”,The speech represented Ms. Yellen's most extensive comments since taking over as Treasury secretary, and she underscored the scope of the challenge ahead.,“Over the last four years, we have seen firsthand what happens when America steps back from the global stage,” Ms. Yellen said. “America first must never mean America alone.”,Ms. Yellen also highlighted her priorities of combating climate change and reducing global poverty and underscored the importance of the United States helping to lead the world out of the crisis caused by the pandemic. Ms. Yellen called on countries not to pull back on fiscal support too soon and warned of growing global imbalances if some countries do withdraw before the crisis is over.,The slow pace of the deployment of vaccines around the world is also a concern for Ms. Yellen, who lamented that many developing and middle-income countries have been unable to invest in robust rollouts of inoculations, which could hurt the global economy.,“The result will likely be a deeper and longer-lasting crisis, with mounting problems of indebtedness, more entrenched poverty, and growing inequality,” Ms. Yellen said, estimating that as many as 150 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty this year. “This would be a profound economic tragedy for those countries, one we should care about.”,In a sharp break with the administration of former President Donald J. Trump, Ms. Yellen emphasized the importance of the United States working closely with its allies, noting that the fortunes of countries around the world are intertwined.,Overhauling the international tax system is a big part of that. Corporate tax rates have been falling around the world in recent years. Under the Trump administration, the rate in the United States was cut from 35 percent to 21 percent. Mr. Biden wants to raise that rate to 28 percent and increase the international minimum tax rate that American companies pay on their foreign profits to 21 percent.,The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in coordination with the United States, has been working to develop a new international tax architecture that would include a global minimum tax rate for multinational corporations as part of its effort to curtail profit shifting and tax base erosion.,Ms. Yellen said she is working with her counterparts in the Group of 20 advanced nations on changes to the global tax system that will help prevent businesses from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions.,“President Biden’s proposals announced last week call for bold domestic action, including to raise the U.S. minimum tax rate, and renewed international engagement, recognizing that it is important to work with other countries to end the pressures of tax competition and corporate tax base erosion,” Ms. Yellen said. “We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/fashion/sustainability-clothes-environment-technology.html,business,"Sustainability in the fashion industry was once the focus of only a handful of designers like Stella McCartney and outdoor gear companies such as Patagonia.,But traditional and new brands are trying to improve a supply chain increasingly criticized for contributing to landfills and causing other forms of pollution throughout the manufacturing process.,From collaborating on the creation of biofibers to the manufacturing of environmentally friendly tag fasteners, some in the apparel sector are working with technology start-ups to clean up the world’s closets.,The biggest problem rests with the volume of unwanted clothing that winds up in landfills. According to the ,, which works to foster sustainability, clothing production globally roughly doubled from 2000 to 2015. During the same period, the number of times a garment was worn declined by 36 percent. All told, “the equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned or dumped in a landfill every second,” their report found.,Over roughly the same period, according to the ,, 60 percent more garments were purchased, but consumers kept them for only half as long.,But some companies, like H&M, are trying to increase their own sustainability while also encouraging consumers to keep garments out of the trash. At H&M’s flagship store in Stockholm, for example, customers,can pay a nominal amount to have unwanted clothing transformed into new garments through a process that breaks down the old fibers and combines them with new ones.,The eight-step process is designed to make a point, not a profit. “We want to engage our customers and make them understand that their own garments hold value,” said Pascal Brun, H&M’s head of sustainability.,But traditional mechanical recycling that is in wider use has its limits. “As shiny as the fashion industry is on the outside, the supply chain has often relied on 19th-century equipment,” said Stacy Flynn, the founder of ,, a start-up based in Seattle. Companies like Ms. Flynn’s seek to reduce fibers to their basic chemical components and build them back up with less impact.,Evrnu’s first product, which Ms. Flynn said she hoped would become commercially available this year, converts the cotton in garments to lyocell, a cellulose fiber that is now made only from wood.,The process, called NuCycl, will update the initial recycling step of sorting, grading and shredding fabric by adding a camera that can more accurately identify a fabric’s composition. Decorative trim, the content of the label or even the thread used can reduce the cotton content by as much as 20 percent.,“It’s like the difference between cooking and baking — you can be looser with ingredients when cooking, but with baking you must be precise,” Ms. Flynn said. “It’s the same way with chemical recycling — if you know what you’ve got, you can optimize the process.”,The heart of the technology lies in the next step, at the pulp mill, where the shredded fabric is dissolved and turned into pulp. That pulp becomes a thick paper, to be shipped to the next part of the textile supply chain, the fiber producers. There it is repolymerized to make lyocell.,Evrnu has partnered with several brands, including Adidas and Ms. McCartney, to use the recycled fibers in their fabrics. “When the consumer is done with it or if the brand is stuck with a dog, those garments can all come back into the system, be repolymerized and turned into something new,” Ms. Flynn said.,Another area of interest involves new fibers and materials that rely on products that are found in nature but not derived from animals.,Several companies, for example, are developing alternatives to leather, since hides are particularly problematic, from the methane-producing cows that produce it to tanning methods that often involve toxic chemicals like chromium. Vegan leather, despite its environmentally friendly name, is no better because it uses plastic, said Theanne Schiros, a materials scientist and an assistant professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.,One alternative is mushroom leather, which relies on mycelium, or mushroom roots, to produce an animal-free alternative. Mycelium has been used for thousands of years in a variety of ways, Dr. Schiros said, even to dress wounds, but , and designers have set their sights higher.,In addition to Bolt Threads, a fiber and material producer that gained attention last fall when it announced its ,, others companies, like ,, are developing “leathers” from mycelium.,MycoWorks’s chief executive, Matthew Scullin, said that while the company was exploring uses in automotive upholstery, the current emphasis was on apparel and footwear.,F.I.T.’s Dr. Schiros is part of a team at Columbia University working on a bioleather alternative; the latest prototype, she said, is “a naturally dyed, microbe-grown sneaker that is a part of Slow Factory’s One x One initiative,” referring to the nonprofit that works on sustainability and climate issues.,The pandemic has forced her to work from home, rather than at a lab, but she has found a clever workaround.,She used her backyard to test how well the bioleather that had been treated with their plant-based tanning technology would break down — in this case, decomposition is a good thing. After burying the sample she tested the mass of the material, as well as the pH and the nutrients of the soil, for 60 days.,Her home-based experiment, she said, found that after seven days the “samples had visibly deteriorated, were smaller in size and had lost over 70 percent of their mass.”,Dr. Schiros is also a co-founder and the chief science officer of ,, which is developing a wool fiber alternative. Started by three of her former students at F.I.T., the company seeks to create biodegradable fibers based on the DNA of proteins that already exist in nature.,Dr. Schiros has worked as well on an , also begun at the school, which is part of the State University of New York. Research is done in collaboration with Columbia, where Dr. Schiros has a research scientist appointment.,Companies hoping to provide “cradle to cradle” solutions — the term used for processes that intend to keep materials within a circular economy, mindful of the end state of materials at the start of the design process. That is the idea behind ,, a footwear maker that uses primarily recycled materials, said the company’s co-founder Chloe Songer.,Thousand Fell also wants to make it easier for consumers to recycle their shoes. “You can do some great design thinking and great production, but if you’re not set up to actively collect product, it’s a little bit in vain,” said Stuart Ahlum, the company’s co-founder. To that end, in November, Thousand Fell teamed up with UPS to provide consumers with an easier way to recycle their worn-out footwear.,Ultimately these developments will transform the fashion world as long as customers buy in. The look and feel — as well as the price — have to work. “If we could make a shoe for $400 but no one buys it, it defeats the purpose,” Mr. Ahlum said.,Additionally, being environmentally friendly is not enough. As Dr. Scullin of MycoWorks said: “There is an expectation floating around that consumers are willing to sacrifice quality for sustainability. But they’re not.”"

Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Mark Warner of Virginia, both Democrats, signed on as co-authors.,In addition to raising revenue, the plan seeks to discourage companies from shifting profits and jobs to low-tax countries to avoid paying taxes in the United States. It also creates new incentives through the tax code for companies to invest in research and manufacturing in the country.,The proposal would tweak several aspects of President Donald J. Trump’s signature 2017 tax law, which created a series of new mechanisms for how the United States taxes multinational companies. It would increase the rate of a global minimum tax that was included in that legislation and change how it is applied to income that corporations earn in various countries overseas. It would also alter two other parts of the 2017 law in ways that the senators say would better encourage investment in America.,Those measures mirror the Biden administration’s ambitions on international taxation.

That includes raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent and a variety of changes to international tax rates.,On Monday, Mr. Biden continued to press for those tax increases, saying that companies need to pay their fair share and that there was “no evidence” behind concerns from Republicans that raising tax rates would drive investment out of the United States.,“You’re talking about companies in the Fortune 500 that haven’t paid a single penny in tax for three years. Come on man,” he said.,The president is expected to detail as much as $2 trillion more in education, health care and other spending initiatives later this month, much of which would be financed by raising taxes on high-earning individuals. Mr. Biden’s aides have estimated that his international tax proposals could raise more than $600 billion over the course of 10 years.,Mr. Wyden, in a news release, said that the senators tax plan would “not only generate critical revenue to pay for President Biden’s infrastructure package,” but would also “encourage additional investment in the United States and its workers.”,The Senate drafters do not specify the exact new tax rates associated with their plan or how much additional tax revenue it would raise, choosing instead to wait and set rates to match Democrats’ spending ambitions later this year. “I’m going to start rolling out specific proposals so that people can have ideas about how they might proceed,” Mr. Wyden said in an interview last month.,The presence of Mr. Brown, one of the most progressive Democrats in the Senate on tax issues, and the more centrist Mr. Warner as co-authors suggests the Wyden plan could attract widespread support in a Democratic caucus that most likely cannot afford to lose a single vote for Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan.,Mr. Brown said in a statement on the plan that “corporations should pay their fair share, just like Ohio families do, and they shouldn’t get a tax break for shipping workers’ jobs overseas.”,Mr. Warner argued that the proposal would provide an incentive to invest in the United States, saying “we need an international tax system that rewards companies making investments here in the U.S., particularly in cutting-edge technologies that will dictate the future success of our economy and ability to create good-paying jobs.”"

They looked the part on Saturday night, overwhelming Houston, 78-59, in a national semifinal by rediscovering their deadeye 3-point shooting and unleashing a clampdown defense.,The win moved Baylor into Monday night’s title game against undefeated Gonzaga, , that ended with Jalen Suggs hitting a 3-pointer as time expired in overtime. That set up a match four months in making, with a , game here in Indianapolis canceled in December just 90 minutes before tipoff because of a positive cases in the Baylor program. The atmosphere for that game, which would pit the teams who have been ranked atop The Associated Press Top 25 poll almost all season, almost certainly would not match the anticipation.,Contemporary Final Fours have long grown beyond mere basketball games into mega events, played in cavernous football stadiums and accompanied by weekend-long entertainment. The tipoffs, accompanied by a sea of flashbulbs, carry a palpable energy.,This one is noticeably muted because of the pandemic, from the absence of throngs of fans carousing through downtown Indianapolis on Friday night, to the large curtain that divided Lucas Oil Stadium in half — limiting the crowd to less than 10,000. (The semifinals drew a record 72,238 here in 2015.),Also absent, as they have been throughout the tournament, are the team’s cheerleaders and bands — such a staple of the men’s tournament that the N.C.A.A., through its television contract, is required to transport them to the Final Four.,“It still feels like we’re playing basketball,” Butler said. “We go back to the hotel. It’s just us, us the team. And we just got one mission, one goal. I think it will sink in later on in life or maybe two months from now when I’m, like, wow, we’re really in the national championship game.”,In trying to create a more customary aesthetic for television, the organizers filled many of the empty seats with cardboard cutouts — often including schools’ famous basketball players. Occupying several seats were Michigan’s Cazzie Russell, the Fab Five and a more recent star, Trey Burke. ,, occupied another. As did a startlingly clean-shaven Justin Turner — in his Cal State Fullerton baseball uniform.,Turner’s presence was a reminder that, while the men’s and women’s tournaments have largely proceeded uninterrupted — the Virginia Commonwealth men were the only team to leave the tournament because of virus cases — playing in a pandemic can be a capricious exercise. Turner, the third baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers, , because of a positive test.,There was no such intervention on behalf of Houston on Saturday.,The Cougars, playing in their first Final Four since 1984, had their mettle tested on path to a national semifinal — rallying from 10 points down to beat Rutgers and mustering enough to finish off Oregon State after blowing a 17-point lead — but they only had to beat double-digit seeds to get there.,Houston carried with it an intransigent defense team whose senior guard, spindly DeJon Jarreau, locked down two of the tournament’s hottest scorers, Syracuse’s Buddy Boeheim and Oregon State’s Ethan Thompson. But it is hardly an exaggeration to suggest that the Cougars’ best scoring option is an offensive rebound. They led the nation in offensive rebounding percentage, according to KenPom.com, grabbing 39.8 percent of their missed shots.,The Cougars’ first possession had to give Baylor Coach Scott Drew pause when Reggie Chaney and Justin Gorham grabbed offensive rebounds for Houston before Marcus Sasser sank a wide-open 3-pointer.,It turned out to be the last hurrah for Houston.,Baylor locked down everybody but Sasser, securing the defensive boards and assailing the Cougars defense with a hail of 3-pointers. When Davion Mitchell swished a 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer, it put them up 45-20 — all but giving them a pass-through to Monday night.,The Baylor defense shackled the entire Houston offense with the exception of Sasser, who scored 17 of his team’s 20 points in the first half. Everyone else was a combined 1 for 15 at halftime.,The Bears, who were the best 3-point shooting team in the country during the regular season, regained their form — especially Butler, who made 4 of 5 behind the arc and scored 17 points, all in the first half. His backcourt mates, Mitchell and MaCio Teague, contributed mightily with 12 points and 11 assists for Mitchell and 11 points and 6 assists for Teague.,And while Houston did manage 14 offensive rebounds, those were offset by 13 by Baylor and the Cougars’ 38.2 percent shooting.,If Baylor can replicate Saturday’s performance, it would cap a lengthy climb from an ignominious depth.,Drew was hired in 2003 after , — one Baylor player murdered another and the coach at the time, Dave Bliss, instructed players to lie to investigators, who uncovered a variety of rule breaking in the program. The Bears were hit with severe penalties, including a ban on nonconference games in 2006, and won 21 games total in Drew’s first three seasons.,They reached respectability eventually. And they took advantage of broken brackets to reach regional finals in 2010 and 2012. Those accomplishments came amid an N.C.A.A. investigation that found that Baylor coaches had made 1,200 impermissible phone calls or texts to recruits and Drew was cited for failing to monitor his program.,Now, though, the Bears are one game away from a title that few, including their star guard, might have seen coming."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/education/online-learning-older-adults.html,business,"Deb Livingston, a former business consultant, was always curious and eager to learn just about anything.,“When the pandemic hit, I was confined at home and found myself diving into online exploration,” said Ms. Livingston, 61. She discovered ,, an interactive website that delivers virtual education to older adults.,Even former chief executives like Jeff Mihm, a Miami resident who led Noven Pharmaceuticals, sometimes need a new life direction.,After resigning from his corporate post, Mr. Mihm, 55, decided to go back to school — virtually, because of the pandemic — and enrolled in the University of Texas’s , in September. “I have a love of learning, and it was an opportunity to step back, study and explore,” he said.,The internet has empowered adult learners by providing new online tools to ramp up education and training. “The need for workers to keep pace with fast-moving economic, cultural and technological changes, combined with longer careers, will add up to great swaths of adults who need to learn more than generations past — and faster than ever,” said Luke Yoquinto, a research associate at the M.I.T. AgeLab and co-author of “,.”,By 2034, the number of adults age 65 and older will outnumber those under the age of 18, according to the ,. “That growth of older age demographics will translate to new demand for enrichment in the form of digital education,” Mr. Yoquinto said. “I would say that, for both good and ill, older demographics are going to serve as a proving ground for learning technologies in the coming years.”,Adult education, however, is “the Wild West” of education technology, according to Mr. Yoquinto. There are many outlets experimenting with ways to get a handle on the online adult education marketplace, including community colleges and universities, for-profit learning platforms, workshop providers and nonprofit organizations.,The new platforms are also opening doors to more adults. “There are already tons of people who, once upon a time, by dint of age or circumstance, wouldn’t traditionally have gotten the chance to partake in education, but can now sign up for free online courses,” Mr. Yoquinto said. Participants can choose a class here and there, without strapping on a backpack and heading to campus or signing up for expensive degree programs.,Virtual learning has become “the great equalizer,” said Gene O’Neill, the chief executive of the ,, which provides continuing education for veterinarians around the world. “Because of virtual learning, veterinary professionals everywhere, even in remote, undeveloped countries, can learn from the world’s most renowned leaders and virtually participate in conferences,” he said. “This puts learning on an equal platform for everyone regardless of geography, income or time constraints.”,Ms. Livingston’s goal was to improve her skills so she could become a paid teacher on the GetSetUp platform, which offers classes — all taught via Zoom by teachers older than 50 — on skills from professional development to technology, health, wellness and hobbies like photography. There’s even a new class about registering for a ,, given the , There are three membership levels, starting at free and topping out at $20 a month for unlimited access.,“The nature of work is changing,” said Neil Dsouza, GetSetUp’s chief executive and co-founder. “The traditional way of designing training and reskilling is a long, drawn-out program where you get a certificate or a degree. By the time you get that certificate, the skill is already outdated. We’re changing that model.”,Ms. Livingston, who lives in York, Pa., signed up to learn how to use Zoom to host classes, how to manage and lead an online class and how to teach Google Classrooms. “Seniors everywhere were in lockdown and were eager to learn and connect,” she said.,Because she’s interested in cooking and eating healthy meals, Ms. Livingston eventually began teaching classes such as “Great Dinners in 30 Minutes or Less,” “Healthy Eating on a Budget” and “Healthy Desserts That Are Delicious, Too.”,In January, Oasis, a nonprofit educational organization, launched , with a menu of online classes on subjects from art to writing. ,, a unit of ,, or OATS, is a nonprofit resource for people 60 and older that offers courses and lectures.,OATS was founded in 2004 in New York City as a community-based project for older adults focused on tech education. Since then, it has expanded to over 200 locations in five states, serving urban and rural communities. But last year it was forced to pivot in response to the pandemic. “We taught hundreds of in-person classes before the virus forced the closure of Senior Planet locations in March,” said Tom Kamber, the founder and executive director.,That’s when his team pulled together and, within weeks, launched a fully digital , of courses and programs that have rapidly expanded its reach to its primary audience — a global community of anyone 60 and older.,Beyond Senior Planet, OATS launched ,, which aims to get one million older adults online. It provides tablets, along with training and technical support, to 10,000 older residents of New York City Housing Authority communities.,“I really wanted to create a program that would be able to get older adults to use technology and give them the kinds of training and support in environments where they could succeed,” Mr. Kamber said.,While older adults are continuing to learn new skills, they also are ,. In 2019, ,, a nonpartisan group supporting entrepreneurship, found that more than 25 percent of new entrepreneurs were ages 55 to 64, up from about 15 percent in 1996.,Online courses are riding that start-up wave. GetSetUp, for example, offers courses on running an e-commerce marketplace, starting a business from home and building a website.,Other offerings for entrepreneurs include ,, a three-month virtual boot camp for entrepreneurs over 50, and the AARP Foundation’s,, which offers free webinars and workshops.,But all these online opportunities are not possible without access to the internet. “While there’s a rising passion for knowledge, people are getting excluded from the educational process in this country because they’re not online,” Mr. Kamber said. Based on a , OATS recently released in partnership with the Humana Foundation, nearly 22 million Americans over the age of 65 lack broadband access at home.,“The good news, though, is the level of sophistication of online education is increasing and more access is coming to rural communities,” Mr. Kamber said. “It’s a brave new world of learning for people, and that gives me hope.”,For Ms. Livingston, that means continuing to take and teach classes at GetSetUp.,“Learning at any stage of life is what stimulates creativity and joy,” she said. “So much energy emerges from connecting the dots, having ‘aha’ moments and gaining skills. I love that I can help others keep their zest for life and help myself in the process.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/business/apps-personal-finance-budget.html,business,"They promise to nudge you into saving more, negotiate your bank fees, cover overdrafts and help you pay down your debt. They’ll even cheer you on when you spend wisely and remind you your bills are coming due.,These are the newest evolution of personal financial management tools, with the emphasis on personal.,Such money management software is not new; ,, the granddaddy of the industry, started in the 1980s to make bill-paying and budgeting easier and evolved as the industry did. Two of the top apps, , and ,, are more than 10 years old.,But as artificial intelligence has become ever more sophisticated, these tools — and almost all of them are apps — have proliferated; it’s almost impossible to say how many there are, but new ones seem to be coming on the market almost daily.,They are “more intuitive, more developed,” said Chanelle Bessette, a banking writer at ,, a personal finance website that also offers its own budgeting , “These apps are getting to know their users a lot better — users are feeding them information about how they spend, and that helps the predictions become even better.”,The apps are essentially looking to become almost as good as a live personal adviser, but one that you don’t pay much for and that can live in your pocket. Some charge a monthly or annual subscription; others are free and make money through referral fees they collect when a user buys the financial products or services promoted on the site.,“Their mission before was to make it easier for consumers to budget, but now they’re really creating features that enable consumers to buy stocks, apply for loans and autosave all on one platform,” said Anisha Kothapa, a fintech analyst at CB Insights, which tracks business trends.,Companies are trying to stand out in a crowded marketplace, and while some are bundling more features to attract users, others aim to specialize.,Such apps are particularly popular for budgeting and setting goals; in this area, Mint, , and , often top “best of” lists.,Like all these tools, they require a user’s credit card, banking and other financial information to track spending and income levels and then automatically sort them into categories.,Each offers something a little different. Mint provides free credit score checks as often as you like (it’s a “soft” check, so it won’t hurt your credit score). You Need a Budget, also known as YNAB, relies on a system called zero-based budgeting, where every dollar is put into an account, such as holiday spending, emergency fund and so on, so that you end up with zero.,“We really want people to be proactive, rather than reactive,” said Jesse Mecham, founder of YNAB. “People think that budgeting means they forecast what they’re going to make and what they’re going to spend; we teach people to budget only with the money you have on hand right now. We want people to change their behavior, and that comes with changing their thinking.”,Other tools are more focused on automatic savings and investing; they have become increasingly creative and game like. , connects with a web-based service, , which allows users to set up rules for saving and investing.,For example, the Qapital app can connect to your Fitbit so that every time you hit a goal (walking 10,000 steps) or fail to meet one (not sleeping enough), you put money toward one of your savings or investing goals. Or it can be unrelated to anything you do — just have it sock some money away when the temperature hits 75 degrees, when it rains or if you visit a favorite place.,As natural language processing, a part of artificial intelligence, becomes more refined, some of these apps are creating a relationship with their users. ,, an app focused on reducing debt, is a chatbot-based penguin who serves as a supportive friend.,“Charlie celebrates your progress, no matter how small or big,” said Ilian Georgiev, Charlie’s co-founder and chief executive. “One thing we’ve heard over and over is that people want a judgment-free environment.”,If you want something that actively helps reduce your costs, some companies have services that look for ways to lower your payments or lop off pesky fees. , is one of the better-known tools — a rare one that is website based, not an app — that, among other things, identifies recurring charges, such as subscriptions, to make sure you still want them. It can also negotiate with your internet, cable and phone company to lower your payments., scans users’ connected credit card and bank statements (how often depends on the level of subscription you pay for), looking for overdrafts and extra fees, said Paul Kesserwani, the company’s founder and chief executive.,Cushion then negotiates with the financial institutions, either through the secure bank portal (if the customer gives permission), through online chat on the bank’s website, or even through traditional mail if needed.,“Bank and credit card terms of service are so complex that’s it’s often easy for people to accrue fees,” Mr. Kesserwani said.,It took four years, he noted, to build up the data set and technology stack to accurately detect bank fees, figure out which ones to negotiate, determine how to approach each negotiation and then communicate with the bank automatically on the consumer’s behalf.,The bells and whistles may be nice, but the benefit of these apps lies in forcing users to face how much they’re truly spending and where it ends up.,“A budget is a fundamental step in financial literacy, and just tracking your spending versus your income is so illuminating,” Ms. Bessette said.,Personal financial management tools can make it easier to budget, save and invest, but you do have to actually use them. According to a ,, after one day, retention hovers around 23 percent and falls to just under 6 percent after one month.,And while users can jump around and test various apps — and try a combination of them to cover specific needs — Ms. Bessette noted that there are benefits to staying with one app for years. “I’ve used Mint for about eight years, and it has all my historical data, which makes it much easier to see trends,” she said.,Because users are giving away some of their most valued financial information, security and privacy are critical.,Read the apps’ privacy policy — it’s best to look for a policy that promises it will never sell your information to a third party, said Paul Bischoff, editor of ,, a tech research and comparison site with an emphasis on cybersecurity and consumer privacy.,And although all the personal financial management companies will promise your data will be held in a virtual Fort Knox, “all apps are secure until they’re not,” Mr. Bischoff said.,It’s not that these apps are in any greater danger of being hacked than, say, your bank or any other institution, but “the more people who have the information the greater the risk,” he said. “I wouldn’t just sign up for apps willy-nilly.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/climate/ocean-blue-economy-business.html,business,"Marty Odlin, who grew up and lives on the Maine coast, remembers what the ocean used to be like. But now, he said, “It’s like a desert and just within my lifetime.” In the last few years, he said, he has seen lots of sea grass and many other species virtually disappear from the shoreline.,Mr. Odlin, 39, comes from a fishing family and has a passion for the history of the ocean and the coast, both of which have informed his sense of the ocean’s decline, a small part of the catastrophic deletion of marine life over the last several hundred years.,Using his training as an engineer, Mr. Odlin has decided to try to reverse that decline with his company, ,, which is based in Portland. Using a combination of robotics, sensors and machine learning, he is building an aquaculture operation that is selling oysters now and eventually clams. He is also using that system to grow kelp, with the goal of producing enough of this seaweed to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequester it by burying it on the ocean floor, and sell carbon offsets.,The company also plans to seed oyster reefs and clam beds along the shoreline, and restore kelp forests and sea grass, to help the coastal ecosystem by bringing back biodiversity and improving water quality, among other benefits.,Mr. Odlin’s plans are one of a number of efforts in the “blue economy,” a term used to describe commercial activity on the oceans, seas and coasts. He and others are trying to prove that ocean conservation, sustainable fishing and carbon sequestration can be good for business, especially as global shipping, aquaculture and the appetite for wild seafood increases around the world.,Mr. Odlin and his team build everything: boats, oyster floats, sensors and more, all with very high sensitivity to their environment. They measure the amount of feed in the water and the growth rate of the various species and send that information into a database that they use to make all sorts of decisions: whether to change the feed, reposition the shellfish floats or make bigger changes about the varieties they’re growing. They also use the hard-won knowledge of commercial fishermen — there are about a dozen on staff — which Mr. Odlin said was a huge advantage.,The climate crisis demands technological innovations and “hard hats and steel toes,” he said.,Dan Watson, the chief executive and co-founder of ,, also has recognized the benefits of working alongside industry and demonstrating profitability.,His company builds high-tech fishing nets for trawling boats: Attached to the nets are LED lights that flash in various patterns and levels of brightness to signal emergency escape hatches (right-size holes) for those species that fishing boats aren’t trying to catch, known collectively as bycatch., that LED lights can , the amount of unwanted species that end up in fishing nets.,, about 9.1 million tons, or just over 10 percent of all of the fish caught every year, are thrown away, with nearly half coming from trawling nets.,In an era of overfishing and , that defy international regulations, reducing the amount of fish or other marine animals that are caught by mistake could have important consequences for the health of various populations as well as ocean biodiversity as a whole, Mr. Watson said.,“When I started all of this, I was a student, and I had the attitude of, ‘This is going to save the world and everyone should do it,’” Mr. Watson said.,“I had to turn more towards, ‘Here is the value proposition, and there is a strong financial argument for catching the right fish,’” he added. “We can show crews, ‘Here is what you save on fuel, here is what you save on regulatory fines.’”,Others, too, see the value of working with industry groups. , is an initiative from the University of California Santa Barbara to help big ships avoid hitting whales as they travel through ports around Los Angeles. The program came, in part, as a response to shipping companies asking for help, according to Douglas McCauley, a professor of ocean science at U.C.S.B.,Ship strikes, as they are known, are among the leading causes of death for whales, and 2018 and 2019 were the worst years on record for collisions on the West Coast, with 27 total resulting in 22 deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Scientists estimate that the actual number of whales killed by ships could be much higher — ,— because not all of the bodies are discovered.,Dr. McCauley helped bring together ocean technologists working at U.C.S.B. to build a near real-time detection system for whales in the Santa Barbara Channel, ,: an artificial intelligence algorithm that analyzes whale sounds, classifies them by species, and sends the data for review; a remote sensing system that predictively forecasts whale presence; and plain old citizen science, where trained whale watchers log whales into a mobile app.,“It’s not helpful if you’re only able to say, ‘Southern California is forecast to be cloudy with a chance of blue whales,” and this model forecasts at a much finer scale, Dr. McCauley said.,The system delivers the information to ships in a simplified rubric of low, medium, high and very high, so that they can slow if whales are around, which can ,. Whale Safe provides data about only this particular stretch of the California coast, but Dr. McCauley said they were planning to expand to San Francisco and possibly elsewhere in North America.,When ships reduce their speed they use less fuel, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; the global shipping industry accounts for ,.,Cargo ships typically burn dirty fuel that releases pollutants like nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which can cause various cancers and childhood asthma for people living in port cities. ,.,In only six months, slower speeds in the Santa Barbara and San Francisco areas , from nitrous oxide by more than 530 tons and greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 metric tons.,But saving the whales could also have huge climate benefits, Dr. McCauley said.,During their lives and when they die, whales help sequester enormous amounts of carbon dioxide in two ways. When alive, whales supply phytoplankton (which suck up carbon dioxide) with the nutrients they need to grow. When whales die, their bodies sink to the bottom of the ocean and over time become part of the marine sediment layer, where they can sequester the carbon dioxide they have accumulated during their life span, an average of , for a great whale species, keeping it out of the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years.,Any of these projects require a more hands-on approach to saving the ocean and a more deliberate overlap of business and conservation, which have historically been at odds, said Mr. Odlin, the founder of Running Tide.,“We have to take a more active role in solving the problem that we’re seeing,” he said. “And how do you take a more active role? The moral imperative is that you have to build something at the scale of the problem.”,Otherwise, he said, “generations in front of us are not going to forgive us.”,“We still have a chance right now, so I’m working as hard as I can.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/technology/cyber-hackers-usa.html,business,"If ever there was a sign the United States was losing control of information warfare, of its own warriors, it was the moment one of its own, a young American contractor, saw first lady Michelle Obama’s emails pop up on his screen.,For months, David Evenden, a former National Security Agency analyst, questioned what he was doing in Abu Dhabi. He, like two dozen other N.S.A. analysts and contractors, had been lured to the United Arab Emirates by a boutique Beltway contractor with offers to double, even quadruple, their salaries and promises of a tax-free lifestyle in the Gulf’s luxury playground. The work would be the same as it had been at the agency, they were told, just on behalf of a close ally. It was all a natural extension of America’s War on Terror.,Mr. Evenden started tracking terror cells in the Gulf. This was 2014, ISIS had just laid siege to Mosul and Tikrit and Mr. Evenden tracked its members as they switched out burner phones and messaging apps.,The images they traded back and forth could be brutal, but this was his calling, Mr. Evenden told himself. A theology major, he’d set out to be a chaplain. He was a long way from that, but what better way to prove your faith, he thought, than hunting those who sought to murder good Christians. Soon, though, he was assigned to a new project: proving the Emiratis’ neighbor, Qatar, was funding the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way to do that, Mr. Evenden told his bosses, would be to hack Qatar.,“Go for it,” they told him. No matter that Qatar was also an American ally or that, once inside its networks, his bosses showed no interest in ever getting out.,Before long his team at the contractor, CyberPoint, was hacking Emirati enemies, real and perceived, all over the world: Soccer officials at FIFA, the monarchy’s Twitter critics, and especially Qatari royals. They wanted to know where they were flying, who they were meeting, what they were saying. This too was part of the mission, Mr. Evenden was told; it had all been cleared up high. In the War on Terror and the cyber arms market, you could rationalize just about anything.,All the rationalizations were stripped away the day emails from the first lady of the United States popped up on his screen. In late 2015, Michelle Obama’s team was putting the finishing touches on a trip to the Middle East. Qatar’s Sheikha Moza bint Nasser had invited Mrs. Obama to speak at her annual education summit in Doha, where the first lady would promote her “Let Girls Learn” initiative.,Mrs. Obama and her team were in constant communication with Sheika Moza. And every last email between the first lady, her royal highness, and their staff — every personal reflection, reservation, itinerary change and security detail — was beaming back to former N.S.A. analysts’ computers in Abu Dhabi. “That was the moment I said, ‘We shouldn’t be doing this,’ he told me. “We should not be targeting these people.”,Mr. Evenden and his family were soon on a flight home. He and the few colleagues who joined him tipped off the F.B.I. (The agency does not comment on investigations, but interviews suggest its review of CyberPoint is ongoing.) To pre-empt any fallout, some employees , clean to Reuters. The hack of Sheika Moza’s emails with Mrs. Obama has never been reported.,It wasn’t long after Mr. Evenden settled back in the states that he started fielding calls and LinkedIn messages from his old buddies at the N.S.A., still in the service, who had gotten a “really cool job offer” from Abu Dhabi and wanted his advice. By 2020, the calls had become a drumbeat. “Don’t go,” he pleaded. “This is not the work you think you will be doing.”,You might think you’re a patriot now, he wanted to warn them, but one day soon you too could wake up and find you’re just another mercenary in a cyber arms race gone horribly wrong.,Three decades ago, the United States spawned, then cornered, the market for hackers, their tradecraft, and their tools. But over the past decade, its lead has been slipping, and those same hacks have come boomeranging back on us.,Yet no one in government has seriously paused to recalibrate the strategy. Not with Michelle Obama’s emails caught in an American contractor’s dragnet in 2015. And not today, with Russian hackers inside our government networks. We went from occasional wake-up calls to one continuous, blaring alarm — and got better and better at ignoring it all.,Months after Mr. Evenden returned home, in 2016, the N.S.A.’s own hacking tools were hacked, by a still unknown assailant. Those tools were picked up first by North Korea, then Russia, in the most destructive cyberattack in history. ,Over the next three years, Iran emerged from a digital backwater into one of the most prolific cyber armies in the world. China, after a brief pause, is back to pillaging America’s intellectual property. And, we are now unwinding a Russian attack on our software supply chain that compromised the State Department, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Energy and its nuclear labs and the Department of Homeland Security, the very agency charged with keeping Americans safe.,We know this not because of some heroic N.S.A. hack, or intelligence feat, but because the government was tipped off by a security company, FireEye, after it discovered the same Russian hackers in its own systems.,The hubris of American exceptionalism — a myth of global superiority laid bare in America’s pandemic death toll — is what got us here. We thought we could outsmart our enemies. More hacking, more offense, not better defense, was our answer to an increasingly virtual world order, even as we made ourselves more vulnerable, hooking up water treatment facilities, railways, thermostats and insulin pumps to the web, at a rate of 127 new devices per second.,At the N.S.A., whose dual mission is gathering intelligence around the world and defending American secrets, offense eclipsed defense long ago. For every hundred cyberwarriors working offense — searching and stockpiling holes in technology to exploit for espionage or battlefield preparations — there was often only one lonely analyst playing defense to close them shut.,America remains the world’s most advanced cyber superpower, but the hard truth, the one intelligence officials do not want to discuss, is that it is also its most targeted and vulnerable. Few things in the cybersecurity industry have a worse reputation than alarmism. There is even an acronym for it: “FUD,” short for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.”,When Leon Panetta, then secretary of defense, warned of a coming “Cyber Pearl Harbor” in 2012, he was dismissed as stoking FUD. The Cyber Pearl Harbor analogy is, indeed, flawed: The U.S. government did not see the Japanese bombers coming, whereas it has seen the digital equivalent coming for decades.,And the potential for a calamitous attack — a deadly explosion at a chemical plant set in motion by vulnerable software, for example — is a distraction from the predicament we are already in. Everything worth taking has already been intercepted: Our personal data, intellectual property, voter rolls, medical records, even our own cyberweaponry.,At this very moment, we are getting hacked from so many sides that it has become virtually impossible to keep track, let alone inform the average American reader who is trying to grasp a largely invisible threat that lives in code, written in language that most of us will never fully understand.,This threat often feels too distant to combat, but the solutions have been there for decades: Individuals just decided that access and convenience, and in governments’ case, the opportunities for espionage, were worth leaving windows open, when we would have all been better off slamming them shut.,“The N.S.A.’s fatal flaw is that it came to believe it was smarter than everyone else,” Peter Neumann, ,, told me. “In the race to exploit everything and anything we could, we painted ourselves into a dead end where there is no way out.”,There’s a reason we believed the fallacy that offense could keep us safe: The offense was a bloody masterpiece.,Starting in 2007, the United States, with Israel, pulled off an attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility that destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran’s centrifuges. That attack, known as Stuxnet, spread using seven holes, known as “zero days,” in Microsoft and Siemens industrial software. (Only one had been previously disclosed, but never patched). Short term, Stuxnet was a resounding success. It set Iran’s nuclear ambitions back years and kept the Israelis from bombing Natanz and triggering World War III. In the long term, it showed allies and adversaries what they were missing and changed the digital world order.,In the decade that followed, an arms race was born.,N.S.A. analysts left the agency to start cyber arms factories, like Vulnerability Research Labs, in Virginia, which sold click-and-shoot tools to American agencies and our closest Five Eyes English-speaking allies. One contractor, Immunity Inc., founded by a former N.S.A. analyst, embarked on a slippier slope. First, employees say, Immunity trained consultants like Booz Allen, then defense contractor Raytheon, then the Dutch and the Norwegian governments. But soon the Turkish army came knocking.,Companies like CyberPoint took it further, stationing themselves overseas, sharing the tools and tradecraft the U.A.E. would eventually turn on its own people. In Europe, purveyors of the Pentagon’s spyware, like Hacking Team, started trading those same tools to Russia, then Sudan, which used them to ruthless effect.,As the market expanded outside the N.S.A.’s direct control, the agency’s focus stayed on offense. The N.S.A. knew the same vulnerabilities it was finding and exploiting elsewhere would, one day, blow back on Americans. Its answer to this dilemma was to boil American exceptionalism down to an acronym — NOBUS — which stands for “Nobody But Us.” If the agency found a vulnerability it believed only it could exploit, it hoarded it.,This strategy was part of what Gen. Paul Nakasone, the current N.S.A. director — and George Washington and the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu before him — call “active defense.”,In modern warfare, “active defense” amounts to hacking enemy networks. It’s mutually assured destruction for the digital age: We hacked into Russia’s troll networks and its grid as a show of force; Iran’s nuclear facilities, to take out its centrifuges; and Huawei’s source code, to penetrate its customers in Iran, Syria and North Korea, for espionage and to set up an early warning system for the N.S.A., in theory, to head off attacks before they hit.,When we discovered openings in the systems that govern the digital universe, we didn’t automatically turn them over to manufacturers for patching. We kept them vulnerable in the event the F.B.I. needed to access a terrorist’s iPhone or Cyber Command had reason to drop a cyberweapon on Iran’s grid one day.,There were big payoffs, to be sure, many the public will never know, but all one needs to do is look at the attacks of the past five years to see that “active defense” and NOBUS aren’t working that well.,In a leaked N.S.A. memo in 2012, an analyst warned as much, “Hacking routers has been good business for us and our Five Eyes partners for some time, but it is becoming apparent that other nation states are honing their skillz and joining the scene.”,Only when the N.S.A.’s tools were hacked in 2017, then used against us, could we see how broken the trade-off between offense and defense had become. The agency had held onto a critical vulnerability in Microsoft for more than five years, turning it over to Microsoft only after the N.S.A. was hacked.,By then it was too late. Businesses, schools and hospitals had yet to patch the hole when North Korea used it to attack one month later, or even two months later, when Russia baked it into a cyberattack that decimated vaccine supplies at Merck, cost FedEx $400 million and prevented doctors from accessing patient records. All in, that incident costs victims an estimated $10 billion in damages.,In the wake of those strikes, in 2017, Gen. Michael Hayden, the former director of the N.S.A., and one of its most vocal supporters, was unusually speechless. “I cannot defend an agency having powerful tools if it cannot protect the tools and keep them in its own hands,” ,.,To understand how we got here, facing one escalating attack after another, and how we might possibly claw our way out, it’s useful to look back at the Russian attack that put us on this offensive course.,That year, 1983, workers at the American embassy in Moscow came to believe that everything they said and did was being captured by the Soviets. They suspected a mole, and had it not been for a tip from the French, who discovered a bug in their teleprinters, they might have never discovered the mole was in their machines.,In 1984, President Ronald Reagan personally approved a classified project, code-named Gunman, to find and eradicate any Soviet bugs in embassy equipment. It took 100 days just to get every last piece of equipment back to Fort Meade and nearly 100 more days to uncover the most sophisticated exploit the agency had ever seen.,Sitting in the back of an embassy typewriter was a tiny magnetometer, a device that measured the slightest disturbance in the earth’s magnetic field. It had been recording the mechanical energy from every last typewritten stroke and transmitting the results via radio to a nearby Soviet listening unit, hidden in the embassy’s chimney. By the time Gunman was complete, and more implants were discovered, it was clear that the Soviets had been siphoning American secrets from our typewriters for eight years.,“That was our big wake up call,” James R. Gosler, the godfather of American cyberwar, told me. “Or we’d still be using those damn typewriters.”,If any single technologist can be credited with spurring the United States to scramble, catch up, and take the lead as the world’s most advanced digital superpower, it is Mr. Gosler. When I asked nearly every one of the men who guided the N.S.A. and C.I.A. through the turn of the century to name the father of American cyber offense. None hesitated: “Jim Gosler.”,In Mr. Gosler’s lexicon, there’s BG — Before Gunman — and AG. BG, “Americans were fundamentally clueless,” he told me. “We were in la-la land.”,AG, we were hacking into anything with a digital pulse.,Over his long career at Sandia national labs, the N.S.A., and later the C.I.A., Mr. Gosler made it his personal mission to draw the government’s attention to vulnerabilities in the microchips, code and software seeping into our lives.,He does not discuss any of the classified programs he was privy to, but under his tenure, he helped create a taxonomy of adversaries that could exploit these vulnerabilities and led teams of American analysts and spies to make sure the United States was on top.,But every calorie the United States expended on offense came at the cost of defense. And over the decades, this trade-off gnawed at Mr. Gosler. Finding Gunman in those typewriters had been a feat. Finding its equivalent in our fighter jets or even the average high-end car, which now has more than 100 million lines of code? Good luck.,This, essentially, is the predicament the United States now faces as it hunts down every last vector and backdoor used in the recent SolarWinds attack, so dubbed because Russians used SolarWinds, a Texas company that sells network software to government agencies, grid operators and more than 400 of the Fortune 500, as a conduit.,Occasionally we respond to attacks with indictments, sanctions or cyberattacks of our own. President Biden added $10 billion in cybersecurity funds to his Covid-19 recovery proposal and said Thursday that the United States was “launching an urgent initiative” on cybersecurity, to improve America’s “readiness and resilience in cyberspace.”,But finding every Russian back door could take months, years even. And climbing out of our current mess will entail a grueling choice to stop leaving ourselves vulnerable.,For individuals, this means making life less convenient. It’s not ignoring password prompts and software updates, turning on two-factor authentication, not clicking malicious links. For businesses, it requires testing code as engineers write it, not after it has made its way into consumer hands. It requires adding moats around the crown jewels: using hand-marked paper ballots, removing the controls that govern our nuclear plants, medical equipment and air traffic from anything else.,For the government, perhaps, an easy place to start is setting clear rules that prevent the N.S.A.’s own, like Mr. Evenden’s former employer, from doing the dirty work for other governments where the rules that govern our own spycraft do not apply. And it’s long past time to shut all the doors and windows that should never have been left open.,Jim Gosler worked for decades to keep Americans, and our secrets, safe, to make sure we never had to know just how close to a catastrophic cyberattack we could come. Now, as the country reckons with scenarios he long feared, he realizes the way forward is understanding just how unsafe we already are.,Gunman didn’t impact the average American where they would feel it, but SolarWinds is getting pretty darn close,” Mr. Gosler told me recently. “It’s so pervasive. It’s one step from SolarWinds into the electrical grid. If the average American can’t feel that? What is it going to take?”,Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter at The Times, is the author of the forthcoming book “,,” from which this article is adapted."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/brooks-brothers-retail-bankruptcy.html,business,"ENFIELD, Conn. — The bones of Brooks Brothers stores are scattered across 100,000 square feet here in a warehouse near the Massachusetts border, mixed in with a sea of cardboard boxes and junk.,There are legions of mannequins, empty circular tables that once displayed neckties, posters of horseback-riding gentlemen from a bygone era. There is a whole section of Christmas trees and countless gold-painted ornaments of sheep suspended by ribbon — a , since 1850 known as the Golden Fleece. Blank order forms for tailors are strewn about. A neon sign that apparently still works. There is no apparel, but there are rows of heavy sewing machines that most likely came from one of the brand’s recently shuttered factories. And in the bathroom, a welcome carpet with Brooks Brothers written in cursive sits next to a toilet.,The whole mass was abandoned here in the fallout of Brooks Brothers’ bankruptcy filing and sale last year, the scraps of a retailer that made nearly $1 billion in sales in 2019. Ever since, the couple that owns the warehouse, Chip and Rosanna LaBonte, has been scrambling to figure out how to get rid of it all. Junk removal companies have told them it will cost at least $240,000 to clear the space, which Brooks Brothers had rented through November. In order to pay the bill, the LaBontes are going to have to sell their home.,The couple’s plight illustrates the far-reaching consequences of ,, which cascaded during the pandemic and affected everyone from factory workers to executives. Smaller vendors and landlords have often been left holding the ,during lengthy byzantine bankruptcy proceedings, particularly with limits on what they can spend on legal bills compared with larger corporations. And once bankrupt brands are sold, people like the LaBontes are typically left in the dust.,“It is a very sad situation that unfortunately does happen quite a bit because it is just part of the bankruptcy situation as the statute is drafted,” said James Van Horn, partner and retail bankruptcy specialist at Barnes & Thornburg. “Unfortunately, creditors can become victims, and sometimes they have little or no options to recover what is owed them.”,Retailers like Brooks Brothers were prominent among the more than 600 , in the United States last year, which had the highest number of filings in a decade, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.,The LaBontes, who are in their 60s, have been working with a liquidator to sell what they can of the Brooks Brothers detritus, and are about to list their home in Sherborn, Mass. While they have filed a claim in bankruptcy court, they are anticipating receiving less than 5 percent of what they are owed, if that — and confessed that the proceedings are hopelessly confusing. Most of all, they are angry and incredulous about the situation, especially as Brooks Brothers continues to operate under wealthy new owners.,“We understand going out of business and the bankruptcy, but to dump their problem on us and walk away from it and make us incur this cleanup cost?” Mr. LaBonte said in an interview in Enfield. “Nobody would anticipate an expense like this — we don’t have rainy day money to deal with it.”,The couple bought the warehouse in 2010. They said that it was their first foray into commercial real estate and that they worked on residential projects before that. They have other tenants and a self-storage section, but are frustrated about the mess and the fact they can’t use the space for anything else until it is cleared.,Brooks Brothers, which was founded in 1818 and is the oldest continuously operated apparel brand in the United States, began renting the warehouse in Enfield in 2011, most recently at a rate of roughly $20,000 a month. (Brooks Brothers also has a corporate office and distribution center in Enfield.) The building, which spans about 375,000 square feet, is held by the LaBontes through KBRC Realty. It’s the firm’s sole holding and the couple’s main source of income.,The office attire segment of retailing as a whole was battered last year as many Americans worked remotely, ditching ,. J. Crew and the owners of Ann Taylor and Men’s Wearhouse also filed for bankruptcy, while sales nose-dived at chains like Banana Republic. Temporary store closures added to the distress, along with the cancellations of special occasions like proms, graduations, weddings and other events.,All that led up to Brooks Brothers’ , one of the most significant retail collapses of 2020. Brooks Brothers had dressed all but four U.S. presidents at the time of its filing, and prided itself on its American factories, which were also forced to close.,But investors saw value in the brand, and the retailer was quickly purchased for $325 million by Simon Property Group, the biggest U.S. mall operator, and Authentic Brands Group, a licensing firm.,The firms have been buying up a string of bankrupt mall retailers through a joint venture called,, including Lucky Brand denim and Forever 21, leveraging the combination of Authentic Brands’ expertise in licensing famous brand names in various lucrative and creative (and some say equity-destructive) ways and Simon’s real estate portfolio.,At the time of the Brooks Brothers purchase, SPARC committed to keep operating at least 125 Brooks Brothers retail locations, compared with 424 retail and outlet stores globally before the pandemic.,Under the new owners, Brooks Brothers switched to wire transfers instead of checks, but kept paying rent on the warehouse through November, sending even more goods there as it closed dozens of stores and shuttered its,, Mr. and Ms. LaBonte said. But after Thanksgiving, it sent a letter to the couple rejecting the lease as well as the contents of the warehouse. According to a person with knowledge of the deal, the warehouse and its contents had not been part of SPARC’s purchase of Brooks Brothers. As a result, said Mr. Van Horn said, the new owner most likely has no legal responsibility to the LaBontes.,A representative for SPARC stopped returning requests for comment.,“They used it for all of their store fixtures, so tables, props, fishing poles, canoes, everything you would see that would go in and out of a store to decorate it,” Mr. LaBonte said. “There’s probably 20,000 square feet of Christmas trees — everything except the actual merchandise.”,As to who would want it now: Customers have included local clothing makers looking for mannequins and a set designer from an upcoming HBO series called “The Gilded Age.” Last Monday, an older couple wandered through the space, looking at the Christmas decorations and empty gift boxes. Habitat for Humanity has been looking at the haul for several days and is taking some of the goods. Still, Mr. LaBonte estimated that somewhere around 30 percent of the leftovers have been sold.,The liquidator paid the LaBontes approximately $20,000 to sell what they can through mid-April or so. The couple will not receive a cut, and will deal with what’s left. When junk removal specialists assessed the cost of clearing the space in December, one quote was around $243,000 while the other was closer to $290,000.,“We’re just another Covid casualty to them, we get that,” Ms. LaBonte said of Brooks Brothers. “But I also don’t think they realized how much stuff was there.”,The junk removal firms, which confirmed the prices with The New York Times, said that it was expensive to remove the volume of goods. The costs included labor, multiple trips to dumps, donation and recycling centers, and the use of specialized equipment such as a forklift, large dumpsters and an 18-foot box truck.,“I’ve been doing this for seven years and I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Rick McDonald Jr., the owner of EastSide Junk, which provided the $243,000 quote to the couple. “They left an astronomical amount of stuff.”,When Authentic Brands, the licensing firm, announced the purchase of Brooks Brothers out of bankruptcy last year, Jamie Salter, the company’s chief executive, spoke about the retailer’s legacy and its “incredible history.”,The LaBontes, confronting a warehouse full of some of that history, were unhappy to see those comments.,They put out a statement recently asking: “What kind of heritage can they claim when they operate like low-rent, fly-by-night bullies?”,Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or Vanessa Friedman at vanessa.friedman@nytimes.com."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/business/ppp-loans-minority-businesses.html,business,"Southern Bancorp is a lender serving the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta, where poverty rates are among the highest in America and decades of redlining shaped neighborhoods with little generational wealth.,When the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses started last April, so many of Southern Bancorp’s customers didn’t qualify for the relief money that the Arkansas bank’s chief executive, Darrin Williams, turned to donors to raise money for $1,000 grants so it wouldn’t have to turn applicants away empty-handed.,The bank made 128 such grants, giving more than 100 of them to businesses run by women or minority owners. One let a nail salon owner buy plexiglass so she could reopen. Another allowed a small cafe to buy safety gear for its staff. A day care used the money for the new sanitizing equipment it needed.,“So many companies will never come back, and disproportionately more of those that will be lost are Black and brown businesses,” Mr. Williams said.,Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in March 2020 as an emergency stopgap for what lawmakers expected to be a few months of sharp economic disruption. But as the pandemic raged on, the program — which made its first loans one year ago this past week — has turned into the largest small-business support program in American history, sending $734 billion in forgivable loans to struggling companies.,The program helped nearly seven million businesses retain workers. But it has also been plagued by complex, changing rules at every stage of its existence. And one year in, it has become clear that the program’s hasty rollout and design hurt some of the most vulnerable businesses.,A New York Times analysis of data from several sources — including the Small Business Administration, which is managing the loan program — and interviews with dozens of small businesses and bankers show that Black- and other minority-owned businesses were disproportionately underserved by the relief effort, often because they lacked the connections to get access to the aid or were rejected because of the program’s rules.,After Congress created the program in last year’s CARES Act, President Donald J. Trump’s administration — especially his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin — put a priority on getting money to needy businesses fast. Just seven days after the law was signed, the ,.,But the haste meant the rules were mostly written on the fly. Reaching harder-to-serve businesses was an afterthought. Lenders and advocacy groups warned that the relief effort had structural challenges that were likely to inadvertently but disproportionately harm women and minority business owners. Reaching the most vulnerable businesses required determination, they said, and the program gave lenders no incentives to put in that effort.,The government relied on banks to make the loans, creating ,. Some banks ,, which pushed ordinary customers to the back of the queue. “Mystery shopper” studies found that , than white counterparts.,The program also largely locked out sole proprietors and independent contractors — two of the most popular structures for minority-owned businesses. Those companies weren’t eligible to apply for the program’s first week. When they got access, , — a restriction that didn’t apply to larger companies — prevented many from getting help. Most nonbank lenders, including those that specialize in underserved communities, were shut out for weeks while they waited for the Small Business Administration to approve them.,“The focus at the outset was on speed, and it came at the expense of equity,” said Ashley Harrington, the federal advocacy director at the Center for Responsible Lending.,In the program’s final weeks — it is scheduled to stop taking applications on May 31 — President Biden’s administration has tried to alter its trajectory with , intended to funnel more money toward women- and minority-led businesses, especially those with only a handful of employees.,Mr. Biden , last week as he signed a bill extending the program’s deadline. “Many small businesses, as you know, particularly Hispanic as well as African-American small businesses, are just out of business because they got bypassed the first time around,” the president said.,But Mr. Biden’s revisions — which, most prominently, expanded lending to independent contractors and others who work for themselves — have ,, including the speed with which they were rushed through. Lenders, caught off guard, struggled to carry them out, with little time left before the deadline.,“The rules are complicated and constantly changing, and that alone creates an access barrier,” Randell Leach, the chief executive of Beneficial State Bank in Oakland, Calif.,Because lenders are not required to collect demographic details on their borrowers, data on the Paycheck Protection Program’s racial breakdown has been scarce, but economists have consistently found signs of gaps.,An , noted that some counties with large numbers of Black-owned businesses — most notably the Bronx, Queens and Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit — had strikingly low concentrations of the relief loans. Majority-white ZIP codes in several metropolitan areas had higher loan coverage than ZIP codes with heavily minority populations, according to , released last month.,And data from the Small Business Administration shows the relief effort’s tilt. The vast majority of lenders did not report demographic data on the 3.6 million loans they made this year, but of the 996,000 that included information on the borrower’s race, 71 percent of the dollars went to white-owned businesses.,Pilar Guzman Zavala founded ,, a small chain of restaurants, in Florida 12 years ago. She employed 100 people before the pandemic and had established bank accounts and years of detailed business records. But Ms. Zavala’s application stalled at the first two lenders she tried, forcing her to spend a month hunting before she finally found a local bank that would process her loan.,She’s grateful for the aid, which helped her hold on to 50 workers, but found the process infuriating.,“The financial system doesn’t get to truly small business, Hispanic businesses, women-owned businesses. It just doesn’t,” she said.,Of the 1,300 Paycheck Protection Program loans that Southern Bancorp made last year, many went to customers who had been turned away by larger banks, Mr. Williams said.,In a recent ,, nearly 80 percent of small-business owners who are Black or of Asian descent said their companies were in weak financial shape, compared with 54 percent of white business owners. And Black owners face unique challenges. While owners from all other demographics told the Fed that their main problem at the moment was low customer demand, Black respondents cited a different top challenge: access to credit.,When Jenell Ross, who runs , in Ohio, sought a Paycheck Protection Program loan, her longtime bank told her to look elsewhere — a message that large banks like Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo , in the program’s frenzied early days.,Days later, she obtained a loan from Huntington Bank, a regional lender, but the experience stung.,“Historically, access to capital has been the leading concern of women- and minority-owned businesses to survive, and during this pandemic it has been no different,” Ms. Ross, who is Black, told a House committee last year.,Community lenders and aid organizations took a shoe-leather approach to filling the gaps.,Last year, the American Business Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group, worked with local nonprofits to create a “community navigator” program that sent outreach workers to Black, minority and rural businesses in Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Texas. They plowed through roadblocks, Whac-a-Mole-style.,Language barriers were common. Many business owners had never sought a bank loan before. Several didn’t have an email address and needed help creating one. Some hadn’t filed taxes; the coalition hired two accountants to help people sort out their financials.,“Our folks literally went door to door and walked people through the process,” said Rebecca Shi, the group’s executive director. “It’s time-consuming.”,The group’s work netted $8 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans for 219 businesses. For those companies, the help made a profound difference.,, a New York lender that focuses on historically disadvantaged communities, spent two hours of staff time, on average, on each of the 490 loans it made last year — far more than larger lenders put in. Dozens of its applications took 10 hours or more to complete, said James H. Bason, TruFund’s chief executive.,Many of TruFund’s customers walked in the door after being turned away by large banks, where “not being able to speak to anybody at the bank, sitting around waiting to hear, and then not hearing anything for weeks — all of that created a lot of anxiety for our small-business borrowers,” Mr. Bason said.,Shaundell Newsome, a Las Vegas business owner and a co-chair of ,, an advocacy group, said improving outcomes for Black business owners would require deliberate, sustained changes throughout the banking industry.,“The solution is intentionality,” he said. “What I mean by that is making sure bankers, regulators and policymakers stay intentional on building Black businesses and helping us get access to capital.”,That’s a message Mr. Newsome passed on to Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen in a recent meeting. Ms. Yellen has pledged to increase support for minority-focused lenders and make other changes to alter a financial system that, in her words, still produces outcomes unacceptably similar to those of ,.,Economic crises like the one now gripping the country “hit people of color harder and longer” and intensify economic inequality, Ms. Yellen said at that meeting. “I am worried the current crisis will do this again. In fact, I know it will, unless we act.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/business/bristol-myers-taxes-irs.html,business,"Almost nine years ago, Bristol Myers Squibb filed paperwork in Ireland to create a new offshore subsidiary. By moving Bristol Myers’s profits through the subsidiary, the American drugmaker could substantially reduce its U.S. tax bill.,Years later, the Internal Revenue Service got wind of the arrangement, which it condemned as an “abusive” tax shelter. The move by Bristol Myers, the I.R.S. concluded, would cheat the United States out of about $1.4 billion in taxes.,That is a lot of money, even for a large company like Bristol Myers. But the dispute remained secret. The company, which denies wrongdoing, didn’t tell its investors that the U.S. government was claiming more than $1 billion in unpaid taxes. The I.R.S. didn’t make any public filings about it.,And then, ever so briefly last spring, the dispute,became public. It was an accident, and almost no one noticed. The episode provided a fleeting glimpse into something that is common but rarely seen up close and that the Biden administration hopes to discourage: multinational companies, with the help of elite law and accounting firms and with only belated scrutiny from the I.R.S., dodging billions of dollars in taxes.,Then, in an instant, all traces of the fight — and of Bristol Myers’s allegedly abusive arrangement — vanished from public view.,Like most big pharmaceutical companies, Bristol Myers, which is based in New York, reduces its U.S. taxes by holding patent rights to its most lucrative drugs in subsidiaries in countries with low tax rates. The result is that the company’s profits move from high-tax places like the United States to places like Ireland, which has a low corporate tax rate and makes it easy for companies to attribute profits to locales with no income taxes at all.,The $2 trillion , that the White House unveiled on Wednesday proposed increasing the minimum overseas tax on multinational corporations, which would reduce the appeal of such arrangements.,For the three years leading up to 2012, Bristol Myers’s tax rate was about 24 percent. The U.S. corporate income tax rate at the time was 35 percent. (It is now 21 percent.),The company wanted to pay even less.,In 2012, it turned to ,, the accounting, consulting and advisory firm, and a major law firm, ,, for help getting an elaborate tax-avoidance strategy off the ground. PwC had previously been Bristol Myers’s auditor, but it was dismissed in 2006 after , forced Bristol Myers , to the U.S. government. Now PwC, with a long , Irish tax shelters for multinational companies, returned to Bristol Myers’s good graces.,The plan hinged on a tax write-off known as amortization. It lets companies deduct from their taxable income a portion of the cost of things, like the value of a patent, over a period of years. (For physical assets like office buildings, the process is known as depreciation.),In the United States, Bristol Myers held rights to patents on several drugs that it had already fully written off for tax purposes.,In Ireland, a Bristol Myers subsidiary held rights to patents that it had not yet fully written off.,That mismatch provided a lucrative opportunity. The company moved the patent rights from the U.S. and Irish subsidiaries into a new company. As the U.S. patents generated income, the Irish amortization deductions now helped offset U.S. taxes.,When a company deploys a complicated new arrangement like this, it will generally seek the imprimatur of law and accounting firms. If they vouch for the maneuver’s legitimacy, that can protect the company from accusations that it deliberately broke the law.,In fall 2012, after the new structure was set up, Bristol Myers asked PwC and White & Case to review the arrangement. Both firms provided the company with lengthy letters — each more than 100 pages — essentially signing off from a legal standpoint.,“Bristol Myers Squibb is in compliance with all applicable tax rules and regulations,” said Megan Morin, a company spokeswoman. “We work with leading experts in this area and will continue to work cooperatively with the I.R.S. to resolve this matter.”,A spokeswoman for PwC declined to comment. White & Case lawyers and a spokeswoman did not respond to a list of questions.,But there were ample signs that the I.R.S. would probably take a dim view of the arrangement. A few months earlier, a federal appeals court had , after it challenged a similar maneuver by General Electric using an offshore subsidiary called Castle Harbour. The I.R.S. also contested comparable setups by , and ,.,The Bristol Myers arrangement “appears to be essentially a copycat shelter,” said Karen Burke, a tax law professor at the University of Florida. Since the I.R.S. was already fighting similar high-profile transactions, she said, “Bristol Myers’s behavior seems particularly aggressive and risky.”,The next January, ,. Its tax rate had plunged from nearly 25 percent in 2011 to negative 7 percent.,On a call with investors, executives fielded repeated questions about the drop in its tax rate. “Presumably, all drug companies try to optimize their legal entities to take their tax rate as low as they can, yet your rate is markedly lower than any of the other companies,” said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “So I’m wondering why your tax rate might be unique in that regard?”,Charlie Bancroft, the company’s chief financial officer, wouldn’t say.,The more than $1 billion in tax savings came at an opportune moment: Bristol Myers was in the midst of repurchasing $6 billion worth of its own shares, an effort to lift its stock price. By January 2013, it had spent $4.2 billion. The cash freed up by the tax maneuver was enough to cover most of the remainder.,It is not clear when I.R.S. agents first learned about the arrangement. But by last spring, the I.R.S. chief counsel’s office had determined that it violated a provision of the tax law that targets abusive profit-shifting arrangements.,In a 20-page legal analysis, the I.R.S. calculated that the offshore setup was likely to save Bristol Myers up to $1.38 billion in federal taxes.,After a complex audit, the I.R.S. often circulates its analyses to agents nationwide in case they encounter similar situations. A redacted version of the report is also made public on the I.R.S. website, cleansed of basic information like the name of the company.,But when the I.R.S. posted its Bristol Myers report last April, it was not properly redacted. With tools available on most laptops, the redacted portions could be made visible.,The I.R.S. quickly removed the improperly redacted version from its website. But ,, a widely read trade publication, had also posted the document. When the I.R.S. provided a clean version, Tax Notes took down the original.,An I.R.S. spokesman declined to comment.,Cara Griffith, the chief executive of Tax Analysts, the publisher of Tax Notes, said the publication erred “on the side of not publishing confidential taxpayer information that was accidentally released through an error in redaction, unless it reaches a very high threshold of newsworthiness.”,In the intervening hours, though, some tax practitioners had downloaded the original version from Tax Notes. One of them shared it with The New York Times, which viewed the document without the redactions.,In addition to detailing the offshore structure, the I.R.S. report revealed the role of PwC and White & Case in reviewing the deal. While both firms assessed the arrangement’s compliance with various provisions of the tax law, neither firm offered an opinion on whether the deal violated the one portion of the tax law — an anti-abuse provision — that the I.R.S. later argued made the transaction invalid.,Tax experts said they doubted the omission was inadvertent. The I.R.S. can impose penalties on companies that knowingly skirt the law. By not addressing the most problematic portion of the law, Bristol Myers’s advisers might have given the company plausible deniability.,Both firms “appear to have carefully framed the issues so that they could write a clean opinion that potentially provided a penalty shield,” Professor Burke said.,, a former Treasury Department official who helped write the regulations governing the tax-code provision that Bristol Myers is accused of violating, agreed. PwC and White & Case “are giving you 138 pages of legalese that doesn’t address the core issue in the transaction,” he said. “But you can show the I.R.S. you got this big fat opinion letter, so it must be fancy and good.”,The current status of the tax dispute is not clear. Similar disputes have spent years winding through the I.R.S.’s appeals process before leading to settlements. Companies often agree to pay a small fraction of what the I.R.S. claims was owed.,“There is a real chance that a matter like this could be settled for as little as 30 percent” of the amount in dispute, said Bryan Skarlatos, a tax lawyer at Kostelanetz & Fink.,In that case, the allegedly abusive tax shelter would have saved Bristol Myers nearly $1 billion."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/business/media/fox-news-viet-dinh.html,business,"LOS ANGELES — In early 2019, as the Murdoch family completed the $71 billion sale of 21st Century Fox to Disney, executives at the movie studio learned that someone was reading all their emails.,And not just anyone: Viet Dinh, the Fox Corporation’s chief legal officer and close friend of Fox’s chief executive, Lachlan Murdoch, had brought on a team of lawyers to investigate,the potential improper use of Fox data” by top 21st Century Fox executives he suspected of leaking to Disney while the terms were still being hammered out, a Fox spokeswoman said. The studio’s president, Peter Rice, and the company’s general counsel, Gerson Zweifach, protested that they were merely conducting normal transition planning — and that Mr. Dinh was being so paranoid he might blow up the transaction,The episode didn’t scuttle the deal. But the previously unreported conflict between the studio executives and Mr. Dinh, a sociable and relentless Republican lawyer who was the chief architect in 2001 of the antiterrorism legislation known as the Patriot Act, offers a rare glimpse into the opaque power structure of Rupert Murdoch’s world. The nonagenarian mogul exercises immense power, through News Corp and the Fox Corporation, in driving a global wave of right-wing populism. But basic elements of how his media companies run remain shrouded in mystery.,In the case of the Fox Corporation, the questions of who is in charge and what the future holds are particularly hazy. The company, minus its studio, is now a midsize TV company adrift in a landscape of giants like Disney and AT&T that control everything from cellular phone networks to streaming platforms, film and television. Fox’s profits are dominated by Fox News. Lachlan Murdoch’s more liberal brother, James, who no longer holds an operational role in the family businesses, has made clear he’d like to see a change.,And since the studio sold, a person who knows Lachlan Murdoch said, Los Angeles has become a less hospitable place to him and his family. If you’re a studio boss with actors and directors on payroll, Hollywood can overlook your embarrassing right-wing cable interests. But after the Disney sale, and after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, Mr. Murdoch risked becoming a social pariah. James Murdoch didn’t help when he , about “outlets that propagate lies to their audience.”,Last month, Lachlan Murdoch moved his family to Sydney, Australia, an unlikely base for a company whose main assets are American. The move has intensified the perception — heightened when he stood by as Fox News hosts , their audience about Covid-19 last year — that Mr. Murdoch does not have a tight grip on the reins. The company takes pains to rebut that perception: The Fox spokeswoman told me that Mr. Murdoch is so committed that he has adopted a nocturnal lifestyle, working midnight to 10 a.m. Sydney time. (She also said it would be “false and malicious” to suggest that Mr. Dinh is exercising operational control over Fox’s business units.) It’s such a disorienting situation that one senior Fox employee went so far as to call me last week to ask if I knew anything about succession plans. I promised I’d tell him if I figured it out.,But Mr. Dinh, 53, was ready to step in, and indeed has been seen internally as the company’s power center since before Mr. Murdoch headed across the globe. Mr. Dinh’s ascent caps an unlikely turn in his career that began when he met Lachlan Murdoch at an Aspen Institute event in 2003. The Murdoch heir later asked him to both fill a seat on the company’s board and to be godfather to his son. (“He couldn’t find any other Catholics,” Mr. Dinh joked to The New York Observer in 2006.),Two former Fox employees and one current and one former Fox News employee familiar with his role painted him as the omnipresent and decisive right hand of a chief executive who is not particularly hands-on. (They spoke only on the condition they not be named because Fox keeps a tight grip on its public relations.) While Mr. Dinh is not running day-to-day programming, he manages the political operation of a company that is the central pillar of Republican politics, and he’s a key voice on corporate strategy who has played a role in Fox’s drive to acquire and partner its way into the global online gambling industry.,In , with the legal writer David Lat — headlined “Is Viet Dinh the Most Powerful Lawyer in America?” — Mr. Dinh called suggestions in this column and in The Financial Times that he’s more than a humble in-house counsel “flat-out false.”,“To ascribe any role to me other than my day job, which is overseeing legal, regulatory and government affairs, is not only false, it would mean I have far more time than I actually do,” he told Mr. Lat in his Original Jurisdiction newsletter. “Lachlan hired me for what is very much a full-time job, which I can barely manage to do with 24 hours in the day.”,But his outsize compensation — $24 million in 2019, and $12 million last year after forgoing his salary for much of the pandemic — belies that, as do episodes like the high-stakes confrontation in the Disney deal and his unusually close personal connection to the Murdoch family.,Mr. Dinh, who declined through the company spokeswoman to be interviewed, is a surprising figure to play a central role overseeing the most powerful megaphone of the Trump movement. He’s part of the tight, elite group of conservative lawyers who largely disliked Donald J. Trump’s bombast and disdain for the law — he is said to regularly deride the former president in private — though they appreciated his judicial appointments and some other policies. And Mr. Dinh isn’t just a member of that group, but a true star of it. A refugee from Vietnam who arrived at the age of 10, he , that he worked jobs including “cleaning toilets, busing tables, pumping gas, picking berries, fixing cars”,to help his family make ends meet. He attended Harvard and Harvard Law School. As a student, he wrote a , about Vietnamese refugees — including his sister and nephew — stranded in Hong Kong. The piece helped win them refugee status, and eventually allowed them to immigrate to the United States.,Mr. Dinh arrived with the conservative politics of many refugees from Communism, and followed a pipeline from a Supreme Court clerkship with Sandra Day O’Connor to a role in the congressional investigations of Bill Clinton in the 1990s.,He was assistant attorney general for legal policy on 9/11, and he was “the fifth likeliest person” to wind up quarterbacking what would become the Patriot Act, said his old friend and colleague Paul Clement, who currently represents Fox in , , brought by two election technology companies. Mr. Dinh “led the effort to pull it all together, package it, present it to the Hill and get it passed,” said a former Bush White House homeland security adviser, Ken Wainstein. The package of legislation transformed the American security state, vastly expanding domestic surveillance and law enforcement powers. It allowed the F.B.I. to conduct , of people and groups swept in by an expanded definition of terrorism.,Mr. Dinh was often mentioned at the time as a brilliant young lawyer who could easily wind up the first Asian-American on the Supreme Court. He was also notably image-conscious, and “worked the media like crazy,” recalled Jill Abramson, a former Times Washington bureau chief and later executive editor. He’s also a master Washington networker whose relationships cross party lines. His best college friend is a Democratic former U.S. attorney, Preet Bharara. Through the pandemic, Mr. Dinh left chipper comments on other lawyers’ job announcements on LinkedIn.,Mr. Dinh left government for private practice during President George W. Bush’s first term, and founded and sold a high-end Washington law firm, Bancroft. He developed a reputation as a well-connected workaholic, and a guy who would be up for a drink at lunch.,He is not the sort of boss who worried about his employees burning out. His view was that “the less that he has to think about where his chauffeur is, the more work he can get done,” said a former assistant, Lindsey Shea, who also described him as a devoted mentor.,Mr. Dinh’s close ties to the Murdochs drew criticism when he played a central role in a nominally independent investigation into the phone hacking by Murdoch journalists in Britain in 2011.,Mr. Dinh stepped down from the Fox board to take the legal job in 2018. He tightened the company’s relations to the Republican establishment, with the former House speaker Paul Ryan joining the company’s board in 2019. And he built his own secretive political operation at the Fox Corporation, , Raj Shah, to monitor online criticism of the company and develop strategies for countering it.,Now, Mr. Dinh finds himself in the strange position of many of Rupert Murdoch’s top lieutenants: He is paid like a chief executive, and fills much of the larger strategic role that comes with that job. He also has the sort of leverage you need in a family business, a personal relationship with Lachlan Murdoch that allowed him to take on Mr. Rice, who is himself the son of a close Rupert Murdoch ally. But Mr. Dinh is still working for a business dominated by the need to follow Mr. Trump and Fox’s audience wherever they lead, lest they be overtaken by networks further to the right, like Newsmax. And the family ultimately retains control.,And Mr. Dinh’s own agenda can be hard to divine. In the interview with Mr. Lat, he largely repeated Fox News talking points about the quality and fairness of the network’s coverage. He did also express pride at Fox’s fleeting willingness to cross the president last fall, even though the network subsequently fired the political analysts who most angered Mr. Trump.,“There is no better historical record of Fox News’s excellent journalism than to see how the former president tweeted against Fox,” Mr. Dinh said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/business/covid-vaccine-pfizer-walgreens-three-weeks.html,business,"Walgreens has inoculated hundreds of thousands of Americans against Covid-19 this year using the vaccine developed by Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. But the pharmacy chain has not been following guidance from federal health officials about the timing of second doses.,People are supposed to get two doses, three weeks apart. Walgreens, however, separated them by four weeks because that made it faster and simpler for the company to schedule appointments.,There is no evidence that separating the doses by an extra week decreases the vaccine’s effectiveness. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a three-week gap, the agency , to separate the doses by up to six weeks if necessary.,But Walgreens’s decision, which it didn’t publicly announce, confused some customers and caught the attention of federal health officials. Kate Grusich, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C., said the agency had asked Walgreens to stop using a longer-than-recommended time period between doses.,The company’s vaccine-scheduling system by default schedules all second doses four weeks after the first. Doses of Moderna’s vaccine, which Walgreens is also administering, are supposed to be spaced four weeks apart. Using the same gap for both vaccines was “the easiest way to stand up the process based on our capabilities at the time,” Dr. Kevin Ban, Walgreens’s chief medical officer, said in an interview.,Now Walgreens is changing its system. Starting as soon as the end of the week, the pharmacy will automatically schedule people for Pfizer doses three weeks apart, Dr. Ban said.,Walgreens is one of the largest among dozens of drugstore and grocery store chains that are giving out vaccines allocated by states and via a federal program that the White House said last week would ,. Walgreens , that it had given out more than eight million Covid vaccine doses, including four million in March, and expects to give out 26 million to 34 million before the end of August.,Walgreens, along with CVS, previously led an effort to vaccinate nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, during which the chain gave out Pfizer doses at facilities with visits spaced three weeks apart.,The vaccination campaign is a business opportunity for Walgreens, which is bringing in revenue from the vaccine administration fees paid by government and private payers as well as from purchases made by shoppers coming in for vaccines. The company requires people to create a Walgreens account to search online for a vaccine appointment.,Most other major pharmacies, including CVS and Rite Aid, stuck with the C.D.C.’s guidance on the timing of second doses. CVS, for example, schedules second Pfizer shots for 20 to 23 days after the first shot, said T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for the chain.,Some public health experts believe the U.S. should delay the second doses of vaccines by longer than Walgreens has been doing with the Pfizer vaccine. That way, more people can get partial protection through the first shots. Britain, for example, is delaying second shots by up to three months. Canada has begun delaying doses by up to four months.,But it was a three-week gap that underwent extensive clinical testing, and U.S. officials and Pfizer executives have not voiced support for alternate dosing schedules.,Asked about Walgreens’s scheduling, Kit Longley, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said the safety and efficacy of the company’s vaccine had not been evaluated on dosing schedules different from the three-week gap tested in clinical trial volunteers.,It is largely arbitrary that Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines, which both use similar “messenger RNA” technology, have different dosing schedules. Pfizer’s decision to test its vaccine with less time separating the two shots helped the company finish its late-stage clinical trial quickly and to report results one week faster than Moderna last November.,Walgreens’s decision to not adhere to the C.D.C.’s guidance on dose spacing for Pfizer’s shot left some customers confused. Some assumed, based on their appointment dates, that they would be getting Moderna shots. Then they learned with surprise at their first appointment that they were getting Pfizer.,Mary DeTurris Poust, a writer in Delmar, N.Y., who got her first Pfizer shot from Walgreens late last month, has been trying, to no avail, to reach a Walgreens representative to reschedule her second-dose appointment for a week sooner.,Walgreens’s system currently allows people to rebook their second-dose appointment, but they can do so only the day before the appointment.,“I’m not happy about it,” Ms. DeTurris Poust said. “It gives me one extra week of not being protected, so it means there’s one more week that I’m worried about catching it from someone, or giving it to someone.”,Some public health experts said they were not concerned that Walgreens has been scheduling doses with a four-week gap.,“It’s a week difference. Everybody’s going to need to put it in their contexts and their risk factors, but I think this is a very reasonable approach” from Walgreens, said Dr. Katherine Poehling, a pediatrician at Wake Forest School of Medicine who sits on the C.D.C. advisory panel that recommended that Pfizer doses be given roughly three weeks apart.,But other experts said they were troubled.,“It is not the role of a private, for-profit company to make public health decisions that should be determined by guidelines issued by a public health authority,” said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University.,Dima Qato, a pharmacist and associate professor at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, said she was concerned about how the public perceives inconsistent messages about spacing doses of the same vaccine.,“As we’re trying to build trust in this pandemic, I think this may push us back,” Dr. Qato said.,Walgreens is not the only vaccine provider that has been giving second shots slightly later than recommended. Others around the country have been doing so for months, especially in the early days of the rollout when vaccine supply was constrained and sites had little clarity about which vaccines and how many doses they would be receiving in subsequent weeks, said Tinglong Dai, who studies health care operations at Johns Hopkins University.,The California health system Stanford Health Care schedules all two-shot vaccine doses 28 days apart, with the goal of providing “stability to our patients” while vaccine supply is unpredictable, said Julie Greicius, a Stanford Medicine spokeswoman.,The health department in Allegheny County, Pa., is doing the same at a mass-vaccination site in Castle Shannon that inoculates 5,000 people weekly. That makes it easier to manage staffing and space constraints when the site is offering both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, said the county spokeswoman Amie Downs. She said the county planned at the end of this month to go back to giving Pfizer doses with a three-week gap, after it has stopped giving out Moderna doses.,The vast majority of people in the United States are getting their second shot when recommended, though more people have been getting it later as the vaccine rollout has expanded.,The C.D.C.’s data through March 28 show that the percentage of people who got their second shot after the recommended period but within six weeks has increased to 7 percent from less than 3 percent through Feb. 14, according to Ms. Grusich, the agency spokeswoman."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/business/media/tribune-publishing-newspapers-alden.html,business,"Tribune Publishing, the newspaper chain that includes The Chicago Tribune, The Daily News and The Baltimore Sun, said on Monday that it had begun serious discussions about a sale of the company to a pair of bidders who came through with an offer nearly two months after it agreed to sell itself to Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund.,The new bid, which is for more than the amount offered by Alden, was made on Thursday by Stewart W. Bainum Jr., a Maryland hotel magnate, and ,, a Swiss billionaire who made his fortune as a manufacturer of medical devices., in a company called Newslight. Tribune Publishing said on Monday that it would “engage in discussions and negotiations” with Mr. Bainum and Mr. Wyss. The company added that, for now, it will not “terminate the Alden merger agreement or enter into any merger agreement with Newslight, Mr. Bainum or Mr. Wyss.”,Until recently, it looked as though Alden Global Capital would almost certainly become the next owner of Tribune. Late last month, Mr. Wyss emerged as ,, telling The New York Times that he would team up with Mr. Bainum in a bid for the chain. On Thursday, Mr. Wyss and Mr. Bainum submitted their bid, which valued Tribune at $18.50 a share, beating Alden’s offer of $17.25.,The bid from Mr. Wyss and Mr. Bainum valued the company at about $680 million; Alden’s bid put the value of Tribune at roughly $630 million. The news of the offer was , by The Wall Street Journal.,Tribune Publishing said on Monday that its special committee had determined that the competing bid from Mr. Wyss and Mr. Bainum would be reasonably expected to lead to a “superior proposal” than the Alden bid.,But the Tribune advised caution, telling shareholders, “There can be no assurance that the discussions with Newslight and its principals will result in a binding proposal.”,Nearly two months ago, Mr. Bainum reached a nonbinding agreement to establish a nonprofit that would buy The Sun and two other Tribune-owned Maryland newspapers from Alden, for $65 million, after the Alden-Tribune deal gained shareholder approval.,That agreement ran into trouble soon after it was made, however. Last month, Mr. Bainum, the chairman of ,, one of the world’s largest hotel chains, made a bid for all of Tribune, offering ,.,After considering the bid from Mr. Bainum last month, Tribune said it still favored the agreement with Alden, which had solid financing. At the same time, the board informed Mr. Bainum that he was free to find backers to make his offer more attractive. He did just that by joining with Mr. Wyss.,Journalists in Tribune newsrooms have been sharply critical of Alden, which already owns roughly 32 percent of the company, as a potential owner. Alden is the proprietor of some 60 daily newspapers across the country through MediaNews Group and is known for making deep cuts at publications it controls as it tries to wring profits out of struggling companies. Alden says its strategy keeps newspapers from going out of business.,In an interview last month, Mr. Wyss, 85, said he was partly inspired to join Mr. Bainum by a Times , in which two then-Chicago Tribune reporters, David Jackson and Gary Marx, warned that Alden would create “a ghost version of The Chicago Tribune.” Tribune journalists at other papers have led campaigns to persuade local benefactors to buy Tribune Publishing or at least one of its papers.,Mr. Wyss, the former chief executive of the medical device company Synthes, has a home in Wyoming. A decade ago, he led , for roughly $20 billion. Since then, he has , help preserve wildlife habitats in Wyoming, Montana, Maine and elsewhere.,Mr. Wyss said in the interview with The Times last month that he had joined the effort to buy Tribune because of his belief in the need for a robust press. “I don’t want to see another newspaper that has a chance to increase the amount of truth being told to the American people going down the drain,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/business/voting-rights-ceos.html,business,"On March 11, Delta Air Lines dedicated a building at its Atlanta headquarters to Andrew Young, the civil rights leader and former mayor. At the ceremony, Mr. Young spoke of the restrictive voting rights bill that Republicans were rushing through the Georgia state legislature. Then, after the speeches, Mr. Young’s daughter, Andrea, a prominent activist herself, cornered Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian.,“I told him how important it was to oppose this law,” she said.,For Mr. Bastian, it was an early warning that the issue of voting rights might soon ensnare Delta in another national dispute. Over the past five years, corporations have taken political stands like never before, often in response to the extreme policies of former President Donald J. Trump.,After Mr. Trump’s equivocating response to the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, Ken Frazier, the Black chief executive of Merck, , from a presidential advisory group, prompting dozens of other top executives to distance themselves from the president. Last year, after the killing of George Floyd, hundreds of companies expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.,But for corporations, the dispute over voting rights is different. An issue that both political parties see as a priority is not easily addressed with statements of solidarity and donations. Taking a stand on voting rights legislation thrusts companies into partisan politics and pits them against Republicans who have proven willing to raise taxes and enact onerous regulations on companies that cross them politically.,It is a head-spinning new landscape for big companies, which are trying to appease Democrats focused on social justice, as well as populist Republicans who are suddenly unafraid to break ties with business. Companies like Delta are caught in the middle, and face steep political consequences no matter what they do.,“It was very hard under President Trump, and the business community was hoping that with a change of administration it might get a bit easier,” said Rich Lesser, the chief executive of Boston Consulting Group. “But business leaders are still facing challenges on how to navigate a range of issues, and the elections issue is among the most sensitive.”,At first, Delta, Georgia’s largest employer, tried to stay out of the fight on voting rights. But after the Georgia law was passed, a group of powerful Black executives publicly called on big companies to oppose the voting legislation. Hours later, Delta and Coca-Cola abruptly reversed course and disavowed the Georgia law. On Friday, , in protest, and more than 100 other companies spoke out in defense of voting rights.,The groundswell of support suggests that the Black executives’ clarion call will have an impact in the months ahead, as Republican lawmakers in more than 40 states advance restrictive voting laws. But already, the backlash has been swift, with Mr. Trump calling for boycotts of companies opposing such laws, and Georgia lawmakers voting for new taxes on Delta.,“If people feel like it’s a been a week of discomfort and uncertainty, it should be, and it needs to be,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who has been pushing companies to get involved. “Corporations have to figure out who they are in this moment.”,Throughout it all, Delta was at the center of the storm. Delta has long played an outsize role in Georgia’s business and political life, and since Mr. Bastian became chief executive in 2016, he has engaged with some thorny political and social issues.,Delta supports L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and in 2018, after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Bastian ended a partnership with the National Rifle Association. In response, Republican lawmakers in Georgia voted to , for Delta, costing the company $50 million.,Yet as 2021 began and Mr. Bastian focused on his company’s recovery from the pandemic, an even more partisan issue loomed.,In February, civil rights activists began reaching out to Delta, flagging what they saw as problematic provisions in early drafts of the bill, including a ban on Sunday voting, and asking the company to use its clout and lobbying muscle to sway the debate.,Delta’s government affairs team shared some of those concerns, but decided to work behind the scenes, rather than go public. It was a calculated choice intended to avoid upsetting Republican lawmakers.,In early March, Delta lobbyists pushed David Ralston, the Republican head of the Georgia house, and aides to Gov. Brian Kemp to remove some far-reaching provisions in the bill.,But even as pressure mounted on Delta to publicly oppose the legislation, Mr. Bastian’s advisers were telling him to remain silent. Instead, the company issued a statement supporting voting rights generally. Other major Atlanta companies, including Coca-Cola, UPS and Home Depot, ,, refraining from criticizing the bill.,That passive approach infuriated activists. In mid-March, ,” at Coca-Cola’s museum. Bishop Reginald Jackson, an influential Atlanta pastor, took to the streets with a bullhorn and called for a boycott of Coca-Cola. Days later, activists massed at the Delta terminal at the Atlanta airport and called on Mr. Bastian to use his clout to “kill the bill.” Still, Mr. Bastian declined to say anything publicly.,Two weeks to the day after Delta dedicated its building to Mr. Young, ,. Some of the most restrictive provisions had been removed, but the law , and makes it a crime to give water to people waiting in line to vote.,The fight in Georgia appeared to be over. Days after the law was passed though, a group of powerful Black executives frustrated by the results sprang into action. Soon, Atlanta companies were drawn back into the fight, and the controversy had spread to other corporations around the country.,Last Sunday, William M. Lewis, Jr., the chairman of investment banking at Lazard, emailed a handful of Georgia academics and executives, asking what he could do. The group had a simple answer: get other Black business leaders to sound the alarm.,Minutes after receiving that reply, Mr. Lewis emailed four other senior Black executives, including Ken Chenault, the former chief executive of American Express, and Mr. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck. Ten minutes later, the men were on a video call and resolved to write a public letter, according to two people familiar with the matter.,That Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lewis emailed a list of 150 prominent Black executives that he curates. Before long, the men had collected more than 70 signatures, including Robert F. Smith, chief executive of Vista Equity Partners; Raymond McGuire, a former Citigroup executive who is running for mayor of New York; Ursula Burns, former chief executive of Xerox; and Richard Parsons, former chairman of Citigroup and chief executive of Time Warner.,Mr. Chenault said some executives who were asked to sign declined. “Some were concerned about the attention that it would draw to them and their company,” he said.,Before the group went public, Mr. Chenault reached out to Mr. Bastian of Delta, according to three people familiar with the matter. The men have known each other for decades, and on Tuesday night they spoke at length about the Georgia law, and what role Delta could play in the debate.,The next morning, the letter appeared as a full-page ad in The New York Times, and Mr. Chenault and Mr. Frazier ,media. “There is no middle ground here,” Mr. Chenault told The Times. “You either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote.”,“This was unprecedented,” Mr. Lewis said. “The African-American business community has never coalesced around a nonbusiness issue and issued a call to action to the broader corporate community.”,Mr. Bastian had been unable to sleep on Tuesday night after his call with Mr. Chenault, according to two people familiar with the matter. He had also been receiving a stream of emails about the law from Black Delta employees, who make up 21 percent of the company’s work force. Eventually, Mr. Bastian came to the conclusion that it was deeply problematic, the two people said.,Late that night, he roughed out a fiery memo, which he sent to Delta employees on Wednesday morning. In it, he abandoned all pretense of neutrality and stated his “crystal clear” opposition to the law. “The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie,” he wrote.,Hours later, James Quincey, the chief executive of Coca-Cola, issued a more reserved statement that parroted some of Mr. Bastian’s language, also using the words “crystal clear.” Mr. Quincey, a British national who has managed the crisis from his home in London, then participated in a private 45-minute video meeting with Mr. Jackson and Ms. Ifill and tried to express his solidarity with their cause.,“A lot of C.E.O.s want to do the right thing, they’re just scared of the blowback and they need cover,” said Darren Walker, who signed the letter and is the president of the Ford Foundation and on the boards of three public companies. “What the letter did was provide cover.”,But for Delta and Coca-Cola, the repercussions were intense and immediate. Governor Kemp , of spreading “the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists.” And Republicans in the Georgia house voted to strip Delta of a tax break, just as they did three years ago. “You don’t feed a dog that bites your hand,” ,, the house speaker.,Senator Marco Rubio of Florida posted , in which he called Delta and Coca-Cola “woke corporate hypocrites” and Mr. Trump , of companies speaking out against the voting laws.,Companies that had taken a more cautious approach weren’t targeted the same way. UPS and Home Depot, big Atlanta employers, also faced early calls to oppose the Georgia law, but instead made unspecific commitments to voting rights.,In the wake of the Black executives’ letter and the statements by Delta and Coca-Cola, more companies have come forward. On Thursday, American Airlines and Dell, both based in Texas, , to proposed voting legislation in that state. And on Friday, more than 170 companies signed a statement calling on elected officials around the country to refrain from enacting legislation that makes it harder for people to vote.,It was messy, but to many activists, it was progress. “Companies don’t exist in a vacuum,” said Stacey Abrams, who has worked for years to get out the Black vote in Georgia. “It’s going to take a national response by corporations to stop what happened in Georgia from happening in other states.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html,business,"SEATTLE — Amazon illegally retaliated against two of its most prominent internal critics when it fired them last year, the National Labor Relations Board has determined.,The employees, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, had publicly pushed the company to reduce its impact on climate change and address concerns about its warehouse workers.,The agency told Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Costa that it would accuse Amazon of unfair labor practices if the company did not settle the case, according to correspondence that Ms. Cunningham shared with The New York Times.,“It’s a moral victory and really shows that we are on the right side of history and the right side of the law,” Ms. Cunningham said.,The two women were among dozens of Amazon workers who in the last year told the labor board about company retaliations, but in most other cases the workers had complained about pandemic safety.,“We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against our internal policies, all of which are lawful,” said Jaci Anderson, an Amazon spokeswoman. “We terminated these employees not for talking publicly about working conditions, safety or sustainability but, rather, for repeatedly violating internal policies.”,Claims of unfair labor practices at Amazon have been common enough that the labor agency may turn them into a national investigation, ,. The agency typically handles investigations in its regional offices.,While Amazon’s starting wage of $15 an hour is twice the federal minimum, its labor practices face heightened scrutiny in Washington and elsewhere. The focus has escalated in the past year, as online orders surged during the pandemic and Amazon expanded its U.S. work force to almost one million people. Amazon’s warehouse employees are deemed essential workers and could not work from home.,This week, the national labor board is counting thousands of ballots that will determine whether almost 6,000 workers will form a union at an Amazon warehouse outside Birmingham, Ala., in the largest and most viable labor threat in the company’s history. The union has said the workers face excessive pressure to produce and are intensely monitored by the company to make sure quotas are met.,The results could alter the shape of the labor movement and one of America’s largest private employers.,Ms. Costa and Ms. Cunningham, who worked as designers at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, began criticizing the company publicly in 2018. They were part of a small group of employees who , to address its climate impact. The group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, got , to ,.,Over time, Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Costa broadened their protests. After Amazon , its external communications policy by speaking publicly about the business, their group organized , to also speak out, purposely violating the policy to make a point.,They also began raising concerns about safety in Amazon’s warehouses at the start of the pandemic. Amazon , Ms. Costa and Ms. Cunningham last April, not long after their group had announced an internal event for warehouse workers to speak to tech employees about their workplace conditions.,After the women were fired, several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, , their concerns over potential retaliation. And Tim Bray, an internet pioneer and a former vice president at Amazon’s cloud computing group, ,. ,Mr. Bray said he was pleased to hear of the labor board’s findings and hoped Amazon settled the case. “The policy up to now has been ‘admit nothing, concede nothing,’” he said. “This is their chance to rethink that a little bit.”,Ms. Cunningham said that, despite the company’s denial, she believed that she and Ms. Costa were prime targets for Amazon because they were the most visible members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice.,The labor board also upheld a complaint involving Jonathan Bailey, a co-founder of Amazonians United, a labor advocacy group. The agency filed a complaint against Amazon based on Mr. Bailey’s accusation that the company broke the law when it interrogated him after a walkout last year at the Queens warehouse where he works.,“They recognized that Amazon violated our rights,” Mr. Bailey said. “I think the message that it communicates that workers should hear and understand is, yes, we’re all experiencing it. But also a lot of us are fighting.”,Amazon settled Mr. Bailey’s case, without admitting wrongdoing, and agreed to post notices informing employees of their rights in the break room. Ms. Anderson, the Amazon spokeswoman, said the company disagreed with allegations made in Mr. Bailey’s case. “We are proud to provide inclusive environments, where employees can excel without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment,” she said.,Kate Conger, contributed reporting."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html,business,"Twelve years ago, the U.S. government introduced a powerful new tool to help people make a wrenching decision: which nursing home to choose for loved ones at their most vulnerable. Using a simple star rating — one being the worst, five the best — the system promised to distill reams of information and transform an emotional process into one based on objective, government-blessed metrics.,The star system quickly became ubiquitous, a popular way for consumers to educate themselves and for nursing homes to attract new customers. During the coronavirus pandemic, with many locked-down homes unavailable for prospective residents or their families to see firsthand, the ratings seemed indispensable.,But a New York Times investigation, based on the most comprehensive analysis of the data that powers the ratings program, found that it is broken.,Despite ,, the system provided a badly distorted picture of the quality of care at the nation’s nursing homes. Many relied on sleight-of-hand maneuvers to improve their ratings and hide shortcomings that contributed to the damage when the pandemic struck.,More than , nursing-home residents have died of Covid-19, and The Times’s analysis found that people at five-star facilities were roughly as likely to die of the disease as those at one-star homes.,The ratings program, run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, relies on a mix of self-reported data from more than 15,000 nursing homes and on-site examinations by state health inspectors. Nursing homes receive scores based on how they fare in those inspections; how much time nurses spend with residents; and the quality of care that residents receive. Those three grades are then combined into an overarching star rating for each nursing home.,To evaluate the ratings’ reliability, The Times built a database to analyze millions of payroll records to determine how much hands-on care nursing homes provide residents, combed through 373,000 reports by state inspectors and examined financial statements submitted to the government by more than 10,000 nursing homes.,The Times obtained access to portions of the ratings data that aren’t publicly available from academics who had research agreements with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S.,Among The Times’s findings:,At homes whose five stars masked serious problems, residents developed bed sores so severe that their bones were exposed. Others lost the ability to move.,But the most important impact may be that the nursing home industry was ill equipped for the pandemic. The rating system allowed facilities to score high grades without upgrading the care they provided.,“They were working to improve their ratings, but not their quality,” said Charlene Harrington, who sits on a board that advises C.M.S. on the ratings system.,“The problems with the five-star system left these homes less prepared in the pandemic,” she said. “They were allowed to not have enough staffing, and they were allowed to ignore infection-control deficiencies, so they had poorer quality than the public knew about, and they were in the worst position to manage Covid.”,Fulton Commons Care, a nursing home on Long Island, is among hundreds of facilities whose five stars reflected self-reported data that was at times inaccurate.,One of the home’s residents was Stasia Kochanowska, a 75-year-old retired nurse. Last March, her son, John Costa, got a phone call from Fulton Commons: She was being moved from a private room into one with other residents. Mr. Costa interpreted that as evidence that the home was short-staffed or overcrowded. “I thought that the idea was to isolate people to keep them safe from the virus,” he said.,Not long after, he got another call: Ms. Kochanowska had a fever. On the morning of April 10, Mr. Costa got the news he had been dreading: His mother had died from Covid-19.,“Looking back now, I realize that the star doesn’t work and shouldn’t be trusted,” Mr. Costa said. “But it’s too late.”,The star system was introduced in 2008. , were buying many nursing homes, and lawmakers worried that the quality of care would deteriorate. (Today, for-profit companies own about 70 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.),The only way to evaluate nursing homes at the time was , called Nursing Home Compare. It included tables of statistics about each nursing home. Consumers largely ignored the information.,The new system transformed hard-to-digest information on resident safety, staffing and dozens of other metrics into simple star ratings.,The rating starts with the grade from the in-person inspections and then awards bonus points for facilities that score well on the other two ratings: for staffing and their quality of care. The staffing score reflects the number of hours that employees spend with patients. The quality-of-care rating incorporates 15 metrics — such as residents’ wounds and medications — drawn from what are essentially medical report cards for every resident.,C.M.S. posts each nursing home’s overall star rating, and its ratings for inspections, staffing and quality of care, on a website called ,When the system was first rolled out, elder-care groups applauded it for providing an easy-to-understand look inside nursing homes. As it gained popularity, it became a powerful determinant of fortunes in an industry with thin profit margins.,Five-star facilities earned about $2,000 in profits per bed in 2019, according to a Times analysis of nursing homes’ financial statements. Those with three or four stars earned about $1,000 per bed. Poorly rated homes were typically not profitable.,But within months of the star system’s launch, members of a Medicare advisory board cautioned federal officials that nursing homes were incentivized to fudge their numbers, according to board members and former regulators. Board members, including Ms. Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of University of California, San Francisco, called for more auditing of the self-reported data.,Audits, however, remain rare, according to 25 former government officials, congressional aides, nursing home executives and elder-care advocates who meet regularly with C.M.S. officials.,The Times found that from 2017 to 2019 health inspectors wrote up about 5,700 nursing homes, more than one out of every three in the country, for misreporting data about residents’ well-being. That included nearly 800 homes with top ratings. Some facilities didn’t tell the government about certain medications they were giving residents. Others didn’t disclose when residents took serious falls or developed bed sores.,Even when inspectors discovered such misreporting, they didn’t conduct more detailed audits of all of the data that the homes submitted to C.M.S.,A spokeswoman for C.M.S. said in a statement that the star-rating system is “intended to serve as one tool” for people to choose nursing homes. “Overall scores should be considered in light of a potential resident’s unique care needs,” she said. (C.M.S. would not identify the spokeswoman.),C.M.S. in recent years “has made multiple substantial improvements to both the ratings methodology and data reliability of the five-star quality rating system. These improvements have made it more difficult to attain or maintain higher ratings, driving providers to continue improving the quality of care they provide,” the spokeswoman said.,She said the Department of Health and Human Services “takes reports of fraud seriously” and that “C.M.S. deploys enforcement and accountability measures swiftly if fraud is detected.”,The warnings about self-reported data have been borne out by researchers.,A , last year by Integra Med Analytics, a data firm started by a University of Texas professor, compared hospital admissions data with the information nursing homes submitted to Medicare. The paper concluded that half of nursing homes underreported potentially deadly pressure ulcers, or bed sores, by at least 50 percent.,In 2019, the , found that nursing homes reported only 16 percent of incidents where residents were hospitalized for “potential abuse and neglect.”,And researchers at the University of Chicago ,, from 2011 to 2015, nursing homes didn’t tell Medicare about 40 percent of residents who were hospitalized after serious falls.,One of the worst offenders in that study was the Clove Lakes home on Staten Island in New York, where 72 residents were admitted to a hospital after falling, but only 15 were reported to C.M.S. A Clove Lakes spokeswoman declined to comment.,Menorah Park, a facility in Beachwood, Ohio, that had five stars, disclosed only 11 of 47 serious falls.,Kathleen DeVito, a former resident at Menorah Park, said in an interview that she selected the facility based on its perfect rating. One night, she said, aides took her to the bathroom and then left her alone. She crashed to the floor while trying to wipe herself. Her ankle was shattered, her medical records show. She now has to use a walker.,“I think about how much better I’d be if I had never gone there,” said Ms. DeVito, 78, a retired paralegal.,Beth Silver, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, said, “The incidence of falls at Menorah Park is in line with other highly regarded facilities at both the state and federal levels, and are even lower for serious falls, which we attribute to our rigorous fall prevention program.”,She added, “While our sympathy goes out to anyone who may have been injured while a resident at our facility, it does not necessarily mean that the facility was at fault or could have prevented the injury.”,In 2018, C.M.S. improved the way it collected staffing data. Instead of asking nursing homes to report the average number of hours nurses and aides spent with residents, the agency required homes to submit payroll records that logged their daily hours. The hope was that such data would be harder to manipulate.,With the payroll records, nursing homes’ average staffing numbers plummeted, according to the Times analysis. That suggested that homes had previously been inflating their nursing data.,Even with the new system, many homes still appear to exaggerate how much time nurses spend with patients.,The Times analyzed the publicly available staffing logs submitted to C.M.S. Thousands of homes — including more than 450 with four or five stars for staffing — derived at least half of their nursing hours from administrators who don’t care for patients. C.M.S. permits the practice, but the public sees only the total number of hours, not the breakdown between administrative nurses and registered nurses who care for patients.,Sun Terrace Healthcare Center had a two-star rating for staffing in early 2019. Then, in the second half of the year, the home, in Sun City Center, Fla., reported a surge in its nursing hours. The bulk of that increase was from the addition of administrators to the tally. By January 2020, Sun Terrace had a five-star rating.,“The administrative nursing staff at Sun Terrace work very closely with the direct care staff in a collaborative team approach to ensure the facility provides the best possible care for each and every resident,” said Alexander J. Kusmierz, the facility’s executive director.,In light of questions from The Times, Mr. Kusmierz said, the home would audit the staffing data it has reported to C.M.S. “Sun Terrace will continue to make certain that the information provided is thorough and accurate,” he said.,Researchers have , that the better staffed a facility was, the fewer residents they lost to Covid-19. More employees meant that patients received better care and were more closely monitored. When the pandemic hit, staffing came under additional strain as nurses and workers fell ill.,Trinity Homes, a facility with 230 beds in Minot, N.D., received five stars for its staffing levels. But residents repeatedly complained to inspectors that the place was short-staffed. In 2019, half of Trinity’s nursing hours came from administrators.,More than 130 residents contracted Covid-19. Thirty-five died.,Karim Tripodina, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the home complies with C.M.S. requirements and has “ample staff to care for our residents.” She said that Covid-19 spread inside the facility at the same time it was spreading in the local community, “despite aggressive efforts to maintain a safe environment.”,Carrie Johnson, 75, had just had spinal fusion surgery. A raw incision snaked up her back, and it needed to be cleaned regularly to prevent infection. She couldn’t control her bowels.,Using the C.M.S. website, Ms. Johnson found a nursing home, Brookdale Richmond Place, where she could recuperate. Part of the country’s largest chain of senior living communities, it was a short drive from her house in Lexington, Ky., and the only local facility with a five-star rating for staffing.,“We thought it meant that I’d be safe,” Ms. Johnson said.,That was not what it meant.,At the time, in October 2017, Brookdale was operating with a skeleton crew, according to six current and former employees and court documents filed in a lawsuit brought by Ms. Johnson. Overwhelmed employees at the 120-bed facility would wake some residents as early as 3:30 a.m. to get them dressed for breakfast and then would put the residents back into bed to wait the hours until mealtime, the lawsuit alleged.,More than a week passed before Ms. Johnson was first given a shower, her medical records show. Her surgical wound was not treated. No one came when she rang her call bell for help going to the toilet, so she sat for hours in her own urine and feces. At one point, Ms. Johnson said, a passing maintenance man changed her diaper.,On at least three days in her first month there, no one brought her pain medication. Some days there were no nurses on the floor tending to patients, according to the current and former employees and depositions in the pending lawsuit. Nurses spent an average of less than 30 minutes a day per patient.,Brookdale, however, told Medicare that each resident received an average of 75 minutes of daily care. The home arrived at that number by including nurses who were stationed at Brookdale’s corporate headquarters in Tennessee, some 200 miles away, according to depositions and the employees.,Absent the inflated staffing numbers, Brookdale’s rating would most likely have fallen to one or two stars.,Jessica Crutchfield, a nursing assistant who worked at the Brookdale home while Ms. Johnson was there, said in a deposition last year that her supervisors told her to falsify residents’ medical records to make it look like they received more care than they did. When she refused, she was fired, she said.,Heather Hunter, a spokeswoman for Brookdale, said, “We have detailed policies in place to ensure compliance with C.M.S. reporting rules, and we are not aware of any instance where inaccurate or false information was submitted by any of our communities outside of the confines of the C.M.S. rules.”,Ms. Johnson’s incision began to fester. In November 2017, a physical therapist noticed that it “appeared open and presented with discoloration around incisions.” She alerted the nursing staff, records show, but it took six days before anyone treated the wound.,When Ms. Johnson went to an outside doctor, her wound was infected, medical records show. The doctor sent her to the hospital. The infection left her unable to move. Her muscles atrophied.,Ms. Hunter didn’t comment on what happened to Ms. Johnson. “While The New York Times has the right to print unproven allegations from one side of a lawsuit seeking monetary damages, we choose not to litigate unsubstantiated facts in the press,” she said.,Ms. Johnson now lives at home. She used to manage the kitchen at a local homeless shelter; now she can’t walk or even stand. She said she spends about six hours a day in front of the television, waiting for her husband to get back from work. She misses cooking sloppy joes for her six grandchildren.,“I wouldn’t send my dog there,” Ms. Johnson said of Brookdale. “That five-star rating is garbage.”,Medicare began tracking nursing homes’ use of certain prescription drugs after the Health and Human Services inspector general , that facilities were overusing antipsychotic drugs, which can be especially dangerous for older people. The ratings system now penalizes homes that overmedicate residents.,According to court documents and interviews with nurses, administrators and government officials, nursing homes for years have underreported the number of residents on opiates and antipsychotics.,On Dec. 12, 2017, Eunice Hill checked into National Healthcare Corporation’s nursing home in Greenville, S.C., for what was supposed to be a short-term rehab stay after a nasty fall made it hard for her to walk. (National Healthcare, a publicly traded company, operates 75 facilities around the United States.) Ms. Hill’s daughter, Anne Brown, said she and her mother drew comfort from the facility’s five-star rating.,That first day at the nursing home, staff gave Ms. Hill Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic, her medical records show. She was also given anti-anxiety medications every day for a week.,That is not what National Healthcare told the government. At least four times a year, nursing homes are required to provide C.M.S. “minimum data sets” for each patient, the equivalent of medical report cards that detail things like weight, medications and wounds. In Ms. Hill’s data set, National Healthcare said that she did not receive any antipsychotics and only got anti-anxiety drugs once.,A National Healthcare spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a pending lawsuit that Ms. Hill’s daughter filed against the company.,Ms. Hill, 93 and suffering from diabetes, started skipping meals, causing her blood sugar levels to go wild, according to her medical records. In late December, she was rushed to a hospital. Doctors found her kidneys were failing and that she was severely dehydrated.,She died on Jan. 3, less than a month after she arrived at the National Healthcare home.,At the Good Samaritan home in Albert Lea, Minn., a resident’s foot became infested with , in 2018 after her bandages were left on for days. At Dwelling Place in Dover, N.J., staff didn’t change residents’ , for more than a month last year, increasing the risk of infection.,In both cases, government health inspectors determined that the nursing homes failed to keep their residents safe. Yet both earned five stars.,The C.M.S. rating system puts the greatest weight on in-person inspections; they are the starting point for the final star rating.,But the exams do little to penalize homes with serious problems. At nearly 1,200 homes with five stars, inspectors over a three-year period identified at least one problem involving potential patient abuse, such as violence committed by staff or the failure to investigate injuries, The Times found.,In 2019, health inspectors , a nursing assistant at the Reo Vista home in San Diego had followed a resident who uses a wheelchair to her room from the kitchen, where she was getting a late-night sandwich. The employee pushed her on the bed and raped her, according to the inspection report.,The report classified the attack as a “category F” violation, a low-level problem that caused potential, not actual, harm.,That designation helped Reo Vista hold onto its perfect rating, which it trumpets on its website.,“This former staff member’s actions do not reflect the values we hold at our facility that our overall five-star rating more accurately reflects,” said William Fredricksen, Reo Vista’s administrator. He said the home was using background checks and other means “to ensure that something like this never again occurs at our facility.”,At 40 other five-star nursing homes, inspectors similarly determined that sexual abuse did not constitute actual harm or put residents in “immediate jeopardy,” The Times found.,After a complaint in 2019, for example, inspectors , that a nursing assistant at Hickory Creek in Madison, Ind., had barged into the bathroom while a resident was showering and groped her breasts. Hickory Creek kept its five stars.,Hickory Creek officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,At Manor Care in Boca Raton, Fla., John Schulz, a 57-year-old resident with Alzheimer’s, was strangled to death by another resident in 2019. The state coroner ruled it a homicide. The death doesn’t appear in inspection records at all. The facility has a five-star rating.,“The unfortunate incident was very isolated,” said Julie Beckert, a spokeswoman. She said staff responded “quickly and appropriately” to the strangulation.,In theory, health inspections can occur at any time, without notice.,But The Times found that in 2019 about 70 percent of nursing homes increased their staff on the days that inspectors visited, compared with their typical staffing levels on that day of the week.,On average, the homes added 25 hours of staff time — a roughly 8 percent increase — to their rosters on the day of the inspection. For more than 800 facilities, inspection day was the best-staffed day of the year.,The odds of that happening randomly are virtually zero, suggesting that many homes are able to anticipate their inspection dates.,When inspectors visited Mitchell-Hollingsworth Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Florence, Ala., on a Thursday in,September 2019, the home recorded its highest level of staffing all year: 785 total hours worked by nurses and aides, 15 percent higher than other Thursdays that year.,“We have absolutely no indication of when the inspectors are coming,” said Brian Scheri, the home’s administrator.,In some cases, corruption was to blame. In 2017, a state health inspector in Florida , to accepting $500,000 in bribes for telling homes about future inspections. Fifteen years earlier, the head of Oklahoma’s health department pleaded guilty to similar charges.,Nursing home staff and state-funded watchdogs said in interviews that hundreds of homes seemed to know in advance about the timing of inspections.,“Every home seemed to get a tip and would roll out the red carpet,” said Tony Cisney, a former inspector responsible for visiting about a dozen homes in Kentucky.,The coronavirus hit America’s nursing homes harder than any other part of the country. Nearly one out of every 10 nursing home residents died from Covid-19.,The pandemic laid bare the flaws in the government rating system.,The state health inspections do little to penalize homes with poor records of preventing and controlling infections. From 2017 to 2019, The Times found, inspectors cited nearly 60 percent — more than 2,000 — of the country’s five-star facilities at least once for not following basic safety precautions, like regular hand washing. Yet they earned top ratings.,In San Bernardino, Calif., inspectors wrote up Del Rosa Villa for four different infection-control violations. It kept its five stars. Ninety residents at the 104-bed facility have contracted the coronavirus, and 13 have died.,Del Rosa Villa officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,Life Care Centers of Kirkland, Wash., the first nursing home in the United States to have documented coronavirus cases, was found in 2019 to have weak infection controls, despite its five stars. State inspectors wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.”,Thirty-nine of the facility’s , have died from Covid-19. The home has 190 beds.,Leigh Atherton, a Life Care spokeswoman, said that citation was the only lapse in infection control that inspectors had identified over 32 previous visits. She said the home quickly fixed the problem.,If the rating system worked as intended, it would have offered clues as to which homes were most likely to have out-of-control outbreaks and which homes would probably muddle through.,That is not what happened.,The Times found that there was little if any correlation between star ratings and how homes fared during the pandemic. At five-star facilities, the death rate from Covid-19 was only half a percentage point lower than at facilities that received lower ratings. And the death rate was slightly lower at two-star facilities than at four-star homes.,A facility’s location, the infection rate of the surrounding community and the race of nursing home residents , of whether a nursing home would suffer an outbreak. The star ratings didn’t matter.,That is consistent with academic research. , found little relationship between a facility’s star rating and its Covid-19 infection and death rates.,At Fulton Commons Care in East Meadow, N.Y., its five stars largely stemmed from its self-reported data, which researchers have found at times to be incorrect.,The home reported only 11 instances of residents taking serious falls between 2011 and 2015. The University of Chicago researchers, however, identified 40 falls for which residents were hospitalized. Similarly, Integra Med Analytics found that, at most, Fulton Commons was reporting to C.M.S. one-third of its residents’ pressure ulcers. The research firm , the home deserved one star, not five.,Fulton Commons officials did not respond to requests for comment.,Fulton Commons stopped allowing visitors last March. Automated phone calls assured family members that the virus hadn’t infiltrated the home.,Stasia Kochanowska died from Covid-19 on April 10. That same day, another resident, 88-year-old Adele Guyear, spoke to her daughter, Pamela Martin. Usually bubbly, Ms. Guyear now sounded terrified. She said her roommate had died from the virus. So had two women down the hall. And, Ms. Guyear told her daughter, she had a bad cough.,Ms. Martin initially had been comforted by the home’s five-star rating. But during the pandemic she had struggled to get her phone calls returned. Now, hearing from her mother, Ms. Martin began to panic.,She said she called the home and demanded that Ms. Guyear be sent to a hospital. There, she tested positive for Covid-19. Her mother survived, but she can’t breathe without supplemental oxygen, Ms. Martin said.,On May 15, health inspectors cited Fulton Commons for having a deficient program for preventing and controlling infections. C.M.S. , the problem as causing “minimal harm or the potential for actual harm.” The facility kept its five stars.,Forty-one Fulton Commons residents have died from Covid-19.,“Knowing what I know now,” Ms. Martin said, “you’d have to be crazy to give this place a five-star rating.”,The Times’s analysis of the star system’s effectiveness was based in large part on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S. The Times used data from ,, before the pandemic upended the industry and temporarily changed data-collection practices. The primary analysis examined the characteristics of homes with five-star ratings, including their staffing patterns and code violations.,The core data set was from the Nursing Home Compare system. That included the most recent set of star ratings for each facility and the underlying metrics. To see how these ratings changed over time, The Times also examined , and metrics going back to 2015.,The Times looked at all code violations reported in the three inspection cycles included in the January 2020 data.,The analysis also incorporated nursing homes’ 2019 , (daily logs of the hours worked by nurses, aides and administrators) and , (financial statements that facilities submit to the government). The cost reports were used to examine the relationship between profitability and the star system.,In addition, The Times used summary data provided by researchers who were granted access to individualized data on Medicare claims. By examining how often nursing home residents were admitted to hospitals , or complications from ,, the researchers demonstrated the extent to which facilities underreported serious health incidents in data they submit for ratings purposes.,Susan Beachy contributed research."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-control-bathroom-breaks.html,business,"It has been Day 1 at , ever since the company began more than a quarter-century ago. Day 1 is Amazon shorthand for staying hungry, making bold decisions and never forgetting about the customer. This start-up mentality — underdogs against the world — has been extremely good for Amazon’s shoppers and shareholders.,Day 1 holds less appeal for some of Amazon’s employees, especially those doing the physical work in the warehouses. A growing number feel the company is pushing them past their limits and risking their health. They would like Amazon to usher in a more benign Day 2.,The clash between the desire for Day 1 and Day 2 has been ,, where Amazon warehouse workers in the community of Bessemer have ,. Government labor regulators are getting ready to sort through the votes in the closely watched election. A result may come as soon as this week. If the union gains a foothold, it will be the first in the company’s history.,Attention has been focused on Bessemer, but the struggle between Day 1 and Day 2 is increasingly playing out everywhere in Amazon’s world. At its heart, the conflict is about control. To maintain Day 1, the company needs to lower labor costs and increase productivity, which requires measuring and tweaking every moment of a worker’s existence.,That kind of control is at the heart of the Amazon enterprise. The idea of surrendering it is the company’s greatest horror. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, , “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And , is why it is , Day 1.”,For many years, Amazon has managed to maintain control and keep Day 1 going by dazzling with , and counted on the media, regulators and politicians to ignore everything unpleasant. The few stories about workers rarely got traction.,But it is now the ,. There is widespread pro-worker sentiment in the United States and a ,. In Bessemer, many of the pro-union workers are Black, which makes this a civil rights story as well.,So the costs associated with Day 1 are finally coming into view. And it is showing up not only in Alabama, but in the form of lawsuits, restive workers at other warehouses, Congressional oversight, scrutiny from labor regulators and, most noisily, on Twitter.,In recent weeks, a heated discussion about whether Amazon’s workers must urinate in bottles because they have no time to go to the bathroom — a level of control that few modern corporations would dare exercise — has raged on Twitter.,“Amazon is reorganizing the very nature of retail work — something that traditionally is physically undemanding and has a large amount of downtime — into something more akin to a factory, which never lets up,” said Spencer Cox, a former Amazon worker who is writing his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Minnesota about how the company is transforming labor. “For Amazon, this isn’t about money. This is about control of workers’ bodies and every possible moment of their time.”,Amazon did not have a comment for this story.,Signs that Amazon is facing more pushback against its control have started to pile up. In February, Lovenia Scott, a former warehouse worker for the company in Vacaville, Calif., accused Amazon in a lawsuit of having such an “immense volume of work to be completed” that she and her colleagues did not get any breaks. Ms. Scott is seeking class-action status. ,Last month, the California Labor Commissioner said 718 delivery drivers who worked for Green Messengers, a Southern California contractor for Amazon, were owed $5 million in wages that never made it to their wallets. The drivers were paid for 10-hour days, the ,, but the volume of packages was so great that they often had to work 11 or more hours and through breaks.,Amazon said it no longer worked with Green Messengers and would appeal the decision. Green Messengers could not be reached for comment.,An Amazon warehouse in the Canadian province of Ontario showed rapid spread of Covid-19 in March. “Our investigation determined a closure was required to break the chain of transmission,” said Dr. Lawrence Loh, the regional medical officer. “We provided our recommendation to Amazon.” The company, he said, “did not answer.” The health officials ordered the workers to self-isolate, effectively shutting the facility for two weeks. ,And five U.S. senators wrote a letter to the company last month demanding more information about why it was equipping its delivery vans with surveillance cameras that constantly monitor the driver. The technology, the senators wrote, “raises important privacy and worker oversight questions Amazon must answer.”,Amazon has presented a different opinion of what Day 1 means for workers. The first thing it mentions in its official statement on Bessemer is the starting pay of $15.30 per hour, double the federal minimum wage.,Mr. Cox, who worked in an Amazon warehouse in Washington state, said the higher pay has paradoxically fueled the discontent. The pay “is better than working at a gas station, so people naturally want to keep these jobs,” he said. “That’s why they want them to be fair. I saw a lot of depression and anxiety when I worked for Amazon.”,(Mr. Cox said he was fired by Amazon in 2018 for organizing. Amazon told him he had violated safety protocol).,The confrontation between Day 1 and Day 2 has been sharpest over bladders.,The topic erupted last month when Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, tweeted at the company, “Paying workers $15/hr doesn’t make you a ‘progressive workplace’ when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles.”,Amazon’s social media account fired back: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us.”,This isn’t the way corporations usually talk to members of Congress, even on Twitter. On Friday, after days of being pummeled on the issue, , to Representative Pocan, saying: “The tweet was incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers.” Amazon blamed Covid and “traffic,” not its punishing schedules.,Representative Pocan , with a sigh. “This is not about me, this is about your workers — who you don’t treat with enough respect or dignity,” he wrote.,The bathroom question is one on which the company has long been vulnerable. Enforcement files from regulators in Amazon’s home state of Washington indicate that questions about whether the company had an appropriate number of bathrooms in its Seattle headquarters have arisen over the past dozen years.,The company has “insufficient lavatory facilities for male employees” according to a 2012 complaint received by the state’s Department of Labor and Industries. “Employees routinely traverse multiple buildings in search of available facilities.”,A 2014 complaint filed by an Amazon employee to the same department said employees got 12 minutes a day for “bathroom, getting water, personal calls, etc.” outside of normally scheduled breaks. Those who needed further toilet time had to provide a doctor’s note “explaining why the need to void more than usual.”,The complaints went beyond Amazon’s white-collar offices. A warehouse worker told Labor and Industries in 2009 that a manager and a human resources representative had told her that “there would be disciplinary action against me if I continue to use the bathroom on company time” — she meant unscheduled breaks. The employee added that the H.R. representative told her that “it was not fair to the company that I was getting paid when I’m not working because I’m in the bathroom.”,Amazon did not respond to questions about the enforcement reports. A spokesman for the Department of Labor and Industries declined to comment, except to note that outside of Amazon, “We really don’t get a lot of bathroom-related complaints.”,Other technology companies have prided themselves on overriding mere bodily needs. Marissa Mayer, an early Google employee, attributed the search company’s success to working 130 hours a week — entirely possible, she said in ,, “if you’re strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.”,When Google was a start-up, the notion was that you gave up everything — family, sleep, diversion — so you might become successful and rich. But former workers at Amazon warehouses said that under the Day 1 philosophy, they suffered merely to stay employed.,“I believe many employees have indirectly lost their job for going to the bathroom. You’re like, can I hold it to break time?” said John Burgett, who blogged for several years about working in an Amazon warehouse in Indiana.,His conclusion ,: Amazon was “testing the limits of human beings as a technical tool.”"

Green was No. 21, a dependable and good-natured, if soft-spoken, presence in the defensive backfield. Off the field, he was laser-focused on Black economic empowerment, counseling teammates on financial management and plotting a career helping close the racial wealth gap.,But by late March, after a bruising pandemic year that friends and family said left him isolated and mentally unmoored, Mr. Green’s life appeared increasingly to revolve around the Nation of Islam and its leader ,, who has repeatedly ,. “Follower of Farrakhan,” Mr. Green labeled himself on Facebook, where he described leaving his job and grappling with “some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life.”,None of it appeared to hint at what he would do next. On Friday afternoon, law enforcement officials said, Mr. Green, 25, drove a dark blue Nissan sedan from nearby Virginia to the United States Capitol and , He then got out of the car brandishing a knife and lunged at officers. Police shot and mortally wounded him.,The attack, which pierced through the calm of a spring afternoon on Capitol Hill, halted the return to normalcy that had slowly begun to take hold there following the deadly Jan. 6 riot. It sent the police force that protects the Capitol into a fresh round of mourning and further complicated a raging debate over how to secure the seat of Congress at a time of increasing threat.,And it raised questions about how a dedicated athlete and aspiring businessman with no known history of violence came to turn his car into a lethal weapon. Without a clear motive, investigators were frantically combing through a trove of social media posts and a trail of woes described by people close to Mr. Green to understand what happened.,Police have not categorized the incident as an act of domestic terrorism. A senior law enforcement official, who spoke anonymously to describe the active inquiry, said that, based on early evidence, investigators believed that Mr. Green was influenced by a combination of underlying mental health issues and a connection to an ideological cause that provided justification to commit violence.,Brendan Green , on Friday that his brother had been teetering on the edge for months, plagued by mental health problems and possibly drugs. Noah Green had briefly moved to Botswana this year, he said, and tried to jump in front of a car, before returning and asking to move in with his brother in suburban Virginia, not far from Washington. Brendan Green said his brother had become violently ill on Thursday night and left the apartment, declaring that he was ready to become homeless.,Attempts to reach Brendan Green and other members of the Green family were unsuccessful, including at his Virginia apartment. The family , expressing condolences for the family of Officer William F. Evans, who died in the attack, and speculating that Mr. Green’s struggles may have been related to head injuries sustained playing football.,One of 10 siblings, Mr. Green grew up in Covington, Va., a largely white Shenandoah Valley town of less than 6,000 dominated by a WestRock paper mill. On Facebook, he described it as not “the best of circumstances,” but at Alleghany High School, he was voted the most valuable player of the football team and won honors on the track team.,After a stint at Glenville State College in West Virginia, he transferred to Christopher Newport University, a small public school in Newport News, Va., where he studied business and joined the football team. ,, he spoke of dreaming of vacationing in Jamaica, admiring his grandmother and wanting to meet Malcolm X.,Former teammates described Mr. Green as a hard worker and said he was close to his family, whose members would make the lengthy drive across the state to watch him play. But on and off the field, they said, he kept mostly to himself.,“He would be there, but he like wasn’t really there,” said Chet Wilborne, a fellow defensive back. “I feel like he always felt like an outsider.”,The distance only grew, Mr. Wilborne recalled, after Mr. Green accused someone of drugging him with Xanax, a powerful anti-anxiety drug, without his knowledge. Mr. Wilborne remembered Mr. Green saying that the incident “altered my mind-set about how I think about people.”,“Everybody at school was talking about it,” Mr. Wilborne said.,Another teammate, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation, recalled that Mr. Green would often talk to fellow players about strategies to save and invest, emphasizing the need to close the wealth gap between white and Black America.,Mr. Green volunteered one summer for a college program focused on preventing violence in the nearby Hampton Roads. And after college, the teammate said, Mr. Green began working as a financial adviser, with aspirations to start a finance company to help the Black community and eradicate poverty.,Mr. Green made little secret of his more recent struggles and his apparently intensifying interest in the Nation of Islam. He posted speeches and articles by Mr. Farrakhan and ,, who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, discussing the decline of America.,A string of posts in the early hours on March 17 charted his course as he saw it.,“I was able to graduate with distinction, earn a well-paying job straight out of college, and pursue my graduate degree, despite not growing up in the best of circumstances,” he wrote on Facebook. “My ultimate goal was to learn business, after hearing the words of the Minister years ago, and to use that to improve the lives of communities most in need. Particularly, the communities of black and brown here in the United States.”,But, Mr. Green wrote, Allah evidently had different plans. He said he was newly unemployed, having left his job “partly due to afflictions” left unnamed. He pointed without detail to struggling with “side effects of drugs I was intaking unknowingly.” His ambitions to build a career in business had been “thwarted.”,“I haven’t had much to lean on the past few months, I’ve been faced with fear, hunger, loss of wealth, and diminution of fruit,” he wrote. “My faith is one of the only things that has been able to carry me through these times.”,Mr. Green also posted a photo of a $1,085 donation he made as “Noah X” to the Nation of Islam’s Norfolk chapter for Saviours’ Day, the holiday honoring the birthday of its founder. A group of members standing outside the Norfolk chapter on Saturday declined to comment on Mr. Green when approached by a reporter.,A Black nationalist movement that has pushed for African-American self-sufficiency, the Nation of Islam has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center for “the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders,” including Mr. Farrakhan.,Mr. Green’s adherence is likely to increase scrutiny on the group, as investigators try to determine whether his beliefs played a role on Friday’s attack. The relationship between violence and the Nation of Islam has been debated since it started about 90 years ago, especially as outsiders and insiders have disagreed over its teachings.,“From the earliest times in Nation history, people have been taking these texts and saying, this is about killing white people,” said Michael Muhammad Knight, an assistant professor of religion and cultural studies at the University of Central Florida, who specializes in American Islam.,“The Nation has a very strong anti-violence discourse that goes all the way back to the beginning,” he said. “Consistently, if you look at the Nation, you don’t see the body count that white supremacist organizations have.”,In his Facebook posts, Mr. Green sometimes used apocalyptic language, suggesting he believed in an imminent end-of-world conflict. He referenced the “mother wheel,” which in Nation teachings is a spaceship that will descend on America in an apocalyptic battle, Mr. Knight explained.,In his final Facebook post on March 21, Mr. Green wrote about a “divine warning,” that these were the “last days of our world as we know it.”,Court records in Indiana, where he briefly lived, show Mr. Green had applied in December to legally change his name to Noah Zaeem Muhammad. But when he didn’t show up for a hearing in the final days of March, the proceeding was dismissed.,By then, he was back in Virginia, living with his brother. Just days later, he would drive to the Capitol.,Elizabeth Dias,, ,Ben Decker, and Robyn Sidersky contributed reporting. ,Jack Begg, contributed research."

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/us/politics/domestic-terrorism-biden.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is stepping up efforts to combat domestic extremism, increasing funding to prevent attacks, weighing strategies historically used against foreign terrorist groups and more openly warning the public about the threat.,The attempts to more assertively grapple with the potential for violence from white supremacists and militias are a shift from President Donald J. Trump’s pressure on federal agencies to divert resources to , despite the conclusion by law enforcement authorities that far-right and militia violence was a more serious threat.,President Biden’s approach also continues a slow acknowledgment that especially after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, the federal government needs to put more attention and money into tracking and heading off threats from inside the United States, after two decades in which it made foreign terrorism the security priority.,In an , last month, the administration labeled white supremacists and militia groups as top national security threats. The White House is also discussing with members of Congress the possibility of new domestic terrorism legislation and executive orders to update the criteria of terrorism watch lists to potentially include more homegrown extremists.,The Homeland Security Department has begun a review of how it handles domestic extremism. For the first time this year, the department designated domestic extremism as a “national priority area,” requiring that 7.5 percent of the billions in grant funds be spent on combating it.,Mr. Biden bolstered a team focusing on domestic extremism at the National Security Council that had been depleted in the past four years, detailing officials from the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and the National Counterterrorism Center, according to senior administration officials.,Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, who helped investigate the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, said the Justice Department would also ,.,F.B.I. agents have worked domestic extremism cases for years. But the renewed focus from the highest levels of government is a major shift, especially as the administration grapples with whether current tactics and resources are enough to prevent future attacks.,The decision to confront the issue more directly stands in contrast to the approaches of the Trump and Obama administrations. In 2009, the Obama administration rescinded an intelligence assessment after it mentioned that veterans could be vulnerable to recruitment by domestic extremist groups, prompting political backlash.,National security leaders are now meeting with officials from the Veterans Affairs Department, as well as the Education and Health and Human Services Departments, to directly confront the issue, according to administration officials.,Researchers say that the United States is years behind European countries like Germany and Norway in understanding the threat of far-right extremism. Daniel Koehler, a researcher in Germany who has helped other countries carry out deradicalization programs, said the United States still had not built a system for families who notice a member using threatening language or otherwise signaling that they could engage in violence.,“I have parents writing to me, ‘I don’t know what to do,’” Mr. Koehler said, adding that many American families had reached out to him after the Capitol riot with nowhere else to turn. ,The Biden administration’s emphasis on the issue is a welcome sign for many current and former government officials who have said that such efforts were stunted under the Trump administration.,In September, Brian Murphy, a former head of the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence branch, , accusing the department’s leadership of ordering the modification of intelligence assessments to make the threat of white supremacy “appear less severe” and include information on left-wing groups ,. The Homeland Security leadership under the Trump administration denied the accusations.,The Obama administration also treaded carefully on the issue out of political concerns. Before announcing his presidential candidacy in 2019, Mr. Biden asked Janet Napolitano, who served as the homeland security secretary at the start of the Obama administration, about the decision in 2009 to rescind a report warning that U.S. military veterans were vulnerable to recruitment by extremist groups.,“I thought you were prescient in talking about right-wing extremism and violence in America and motivated by white supremacists,” Mr. Biden told Ms. Napolitano during an event at the New York Public Library.,Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, has had discussions with White House officials about appointing a domestic terrorism czar at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. She has also discussed a potential executive order that would update how the federal government adds individuals suspected of terrorist activity to lists used to screen people trying to enter the country or board planes. Such watch lists are more known for their use against foreign terrorists, Ms. Slotkin said.,“I don’t think we have a good handle on how to think about domestic extremism and these databases,” she said.,During a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month, Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, noted the United States did not have a statute that would empower prosecutors to charge and investigate homegrown extremists with the same tools that are used against terrorism suspects from abroad.,Mr. Biden’s campaign platform said he would work to establish such a law “that respects free speech and civil liberties, while making the same commitment to root out domestic terrorism as we have to stopping international terrorism.”,When asked what the president’s current position on the statute was, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, pointed to a review Mr. Biden had directed the federal government to conduct on extremism “because there is such an expansive impact and threat around the country.”,The absence of a law does not hinder the F.B.I. from investigating such threats, but prosecutors are forced to rely on a patchwork of other charges for domestic extremism, including for the attack on the Capitol.,The Justice Department has unsealed , against more than 300 individuals for their role in the Capitol riot. The charges range widely and include assaulting police officers, illegally entering the Capitol building and conspiring to interfere in the election certification process. The leaders of the , militia and the far-right , group are among the most prominent targets of the sprawling investigation.,Critics of a domestic terrorism statute say it could expand the government’s surveillance authorities too much and be used against minority communities.,A letter signed by Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and eight other Democrats said the intelligence failure surrounding the Capitol breach reflected a reluctance by law enforcement to crack down on white nationalist groups, not a lack of government tools to monitor them.,One homeland security official involved in the department’s review of how to handle domestic terrorism said the agency did not need new laws but should instead employ the tools that have long been used against foreign terrorism.,One strategy is to analyze federal travel data to trace the patterns of possible militia members and extremists, especially as American groups increasingly establish connections to Europe, the official said. Members of the groups can then be added to so-called no-fly lists, he said.,The department’s review is focused not only on clear acts of terrorism but also on those who are pushed to commit attacks because of a combination of mental health issues, grievances and ideologies that provide a perceived justification for violence. Officials are also evaluating how to prevent attacks similar to the one at the Capitol on Friday, where , at a barricade outside the building before getting out and charging them with a knife.,The suspect, who was shot and killed by the police after the attack, was identified by law enforcement officials as Noah Green, 25, of Covington, Va. Friends and family say he struggled with isolation and mental health issues. The police have not categorized the attack as “terrorism related,” and , that showed an intensifying interest in the Nation of Islam.,The Homeland Security Department is also looking to collaborate more closely with private social media companies like Facebook and Twitter to spot indicators of potential violence. The agency had faced sharp backlash for , before Jan. 6, despite a slew of social media posts that armed groups intended to come to Washington to protest the results of the 2020 election.,The Homeland Security Department this year allocated $77 million for state and local governments to train police officers and improve intelligence-sharing across states. ,Separately, the agency doubled the number of grants for organizations developing projects to research prevention strategies, including “off boarding” those vulnerable to radicalization. The allocation of $20 million, which has not been awarded yet, comes after the Trump administration gutted the grants before restoring $10 million in the last year of his term.,But increasing funding and acknowledging the problem are merely first steps. The work of identifying people associated with domestic extremism and helping them disengage from violence remains daunting.,Previous efforts by law enforcement to enlist the help of community members had prompted concern that the federal government was trying to spy on minority communities. ,The Biden administration’s new approach to the issue is trickling down to those on the front lines of dealing with domestic extremists.,During the Obama administration, Mohamed Amin Ahmed, who runs an anti-extremism nonprofit in Minneapolis, had considered applying for federal grants to support his efforts to make cartoon videos seeking to debunk the Islamic State’s appeals to children.,But he decided not to apply after learning that the funding was tied to a requirement that he report suspicious activity to law enforcement.,Mr. Ahmed is now creating videos to target followers of QAnon, the pro-Trump conspiracy theory. He said he was planning to apply for the new round of government grants, which are no longer linked to law enforcement.,“We’re trying to help and not be part of the surveillance state,” Mr. Ahmed said.,After the Capitol riot, anti-extremism efforts are caught in a thicket of difficult political and First Amendment issues. Interventions that aim to change political beliefs or seem aligned with Democrats could be ineffective at attracting far-right extremists to participate, experts said.,A program in New York City, which recently won a federal grant of more than $740,000, will focus on stopping people from committing politically motivated violence without trying to change their beliefs.,Richard Aborn, the president of the nonprofit organization overseeing the program, said that it would accept participants through referrals from law enforcement, including for people who have already been charged with crimes.,Individuals who qualify after a psychological evaluation would then participate in one-on-one therapy for several months. The program’s success would be measured by changes in the individual’s emotional state.,Mr. Aborn said he expected the pool of participants to include white supremacists, jihadists and people threatening mass shootings.,To identify individuals who are not on law enforcement’s radar, Mr. Aborn is planning to develop targeted advertisements that would be seen by people who, for instance, were conducting anti-Semitic searches online. Clicking the ads would direct them to the one-on-one intervention program.,“This is all a new space,” Mr. Aborn said. “None of us know with any certitude about how much progress we’re going to make.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/emergent-vaccine-plant-johnson-johnson.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Saturday put Johnson & Johnson in charge of a troubled Baltimore manufacturing plant that ruined 15 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson , and moved to stop the plant from making another vaccine by AstraZeneca, senior federal health officials said.,The extraordinary move by the Department of Health and Human Services came just days after officials had learned that Emergent BioSolutions, a contract manufacturer that has been making both the Johnson & Johnson and the AstraZeneca vaccines, mixed up ingredients from the two, which led regulators to delay authorization of the plant’s production lines.,By moving the AstraZeneca vaccine out, two senior federal health officials said, the plant can be solely devoted to the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine and avoid future mishaps.,The Department of Health and Human Services directed Johnson & Johnson to install a new leadership team to oversee all aspects of production and manufacturing at the Emergent Baltimore plant, the officials said. The company said in a statement that it was “assuming full responsibility” for the vaccine made at the Emergent plant.,With President Biden making an aggressive push to have enough doses to cover every adult by the end of May, federal officials are worried that the mix-up will erode public confidence in Covid-19 vaccines. The AstraZeneca vaccine in particular has generated safety concerns; Germany, France and other European nations briefly suspended its use after reports of rare brain blood clots in some vaccine recipients.,The ingredient mix-up, and Saturday’s move by the administration, is a significant setback and a public relations debacle for Emergent, a Maryland-based biotech company that has built a profitable business by teaming up with the federal government, primarily by , to the Strategic National Stockpile.,A spokesman for Emergent declined to comment, except to say that the company would continue making AstraZeneca doses until it received a contract modification from the federal government.,Unlike Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca does not yet have emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its vaccine. With three federally authorized vaccines (the other two are by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), it is not clear whether the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has had a troubled history with regulators, could even be cleared in time to meet U.S. needs.,However, one of the federal officials said the Department of Health and Human Services was discussing working with AstraZeneca to adapt its vaccine to combat new coronavirus variants. AstraZeneca said in a statement that it would work with the Biden administration to find a new site to manufacture its vaccine.,So far, none of the Johnson & Johnson doses made by Emergent have been released by the F.D.A. for distribution. Officials have said it may take weeks to sort out whether other batches of vaccine were contaminated and for F.D.A. inspectors to determine whether the Emergent plant can be cleared to release any doses that it has made.,The acting F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, said in a statement on Saturday that the agency “takes its responsibility for helping to ensure the quality of manufacturing of vaccines and other medical products for use during this pandemic very seriously.”,But she made it clear that the ultimate responsibility would rest with Johnson & Johnson, saying: “It is important to note that even when companies use contract manufacturing organizations, it is ultimately the responsibility of the company that holds the emergency use authorization to ensure that the quality standards of the FDA are met.”,In another arrangement , last month, Johnson & Johnson is now working with Merck, one of the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturers. Officials said Merck would help with management of the Baltimore plant.,Emergent’s Baltimore plant is one of two that are federally designated as “Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing” and were built with taxpayer support. Last June, the government paid , to reserve space there as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s fast-track initiative to develop coronavirus vaccines.,Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca both contracted with Emergent to use the space. Both vaccines are so-called live viral-vector vaccines, meaning they use a modified, harmless version of a different virus as a vector, or carrier, to deliver instructions to the body’s immune system. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is administered in one dose, AstraZeneca’s in two doses.,Experts in vaccine manufacturing said that in the past, the F.D.A. had a rule to prevent such mishaps by not allowing a plant to make two live viral vector vaccines, because of the potential for mix-ups and contamination.,Last month, Mr. Biden canceled a visit to Emergent’s Baltimore plant, and his spokeswoman announced that the administration would conduct an audit of the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s emergency medical reserve. Both actions came after a , into how the company had gained outsize influence over the repository."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/us/politics/guantanamo-bay-prisoners.html,politics,"U.S. military guards have moved , and other former C.I.A. prisoners to the main part of the prison compound at Guantánamo Bay from a failing secret facility, in a consolidation of detention operations that could cut costs and reduce the troop presence at the base in Cuba, the military said on Sunday.,Mr. Mohammed, who is accused of being the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, and other so-called high-value detainees at Guantánamo were moved to Camp 5 as part of the consolidation. The two-story building, a maximum-security facility that cost $17 million to build in 2004, is modeled after a state prison in Bunker Hill, Ind. It has a modest detainee health clinic and a psychiatric ward ,, but none of the hospice or end-of-life care capacity once ,.,The maximum-security facility is designed to keep prisoners confined to their cells except when guards move an individual to showers, outdoor cages that serve as recreation yards or another cell where a single captive can sit in a recliner, one ankle shackled to a bolt on the floor, and watch television.,As of Sunday, the military said, , — the 11 men who have been charged with war crimes, as well as others who are held as indefinite detainees — were housed in a compound ringed with razor wire and containing two prison buildings, called Camps 5 and 6.,The plan to consolidate the prisoners was devised during the Trump administration, when their ,. Raw sewage sloshed through the tiers, the power sometimes went out and some cell doors would not close at the site. The situation worsened over the summer amid the coronavirus pandemic because it was difficult to bring in contractors and spare parts.,“This sounds like a solution to the crumbling Camp 7,” said James G. Connell III, a capital defense lawyer who represents Ammar al-Baluchi, who along with his uncle, Mr. Mohammed, and three other men is ,. “They are abandoning it rather than repairing it.”,Maj. Gregory J. McElwain, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, called the move a “fiscally responsible decision” whose planning “involved all relevant organizations to include the intelligence community.”,Camp 7 functioned under a 2006 , between Donald H. Rumsfeld and Michael V. Hayden, the defense secretary and the C.I.A. director at the time. It was not immediately known on Sunday whether a new agreement was reached or the old one was dissolved.,Camp 7 also housed some of the best-known captives of the post-9/11 period, including a Palestinian man known as ,, who is held without charges and was the first prisoner to be , after the attacks; the Saudi man accused of orchestrating Al Qaeda’s bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen in 2000, and who is charged in a death-penalty case that has no trial date; and a Baltimore-educated Pakistani man, ,, who pleaded guilty to serving as a Qaeda courier and was moved from the other prisoners as a government cooperator.,Major McElwain declined to say how much the consolidation cost. Over time, he said, the move would most likely mean a reduction in troops from the 1,500 mostly National Guard members who primarily serve nine-month tours of duty at the detention operation, which has been estimated to cost ,.,Mr. Mohammed and the other high-value detainees were held at the classified Camp 7 site after their transfer to Guantánamo in September 2006. They had spent three to four years in the George W. Bush administration’s secret overseas prison network, known as black sites, where the C.I.A. subjected its prisoners to sleep deprivation, forced nudity, waterboarding and other physical and psychological abuse.,By segregating the prisoners, under the watch of a special guard unit called Task Force Platinum, the intelligence agencies could strictly monitor and control their communications and prevent them from divulging what had happened to them. Defense lawyers who were eventually granted access to the men were bound by security clearances to keep their conversations classified, including in court filings that accused government agents of state-sponsored torture.,Camp 7 was long one of Guantánamo’s most clandestine sites. The Pentagon refused to disclose its cost, which contractor built it and when. Reporters were not permitted to see it, lawyers were required to obtain a court order to visit and its location was considered classified, although sources pointed to it on a ,.,In the short term, Major McElwain said, Camp 7 “will be sanitized, shut down and locked.”,“A plan for its final disposition has yet to be determined,” he said.,The former C.I.A. prisoners were kept mostly isolated in their early years at Camp 7. Each was allowed to speak with only one other prisoner through a tarp during recreation time, in conversations that were recorded for intelligence purposes.,Their lawyers described the conditions as mind-numbing until recent years, when the commanders , under strict surveillance. They also had a cell where they could prepare food to pass time.,It is unknown whether the military will emulate that communal lifestyle in the prisoners’ new surroundings."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/border-migrant-families-children.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration apprehended more than 170,000 migrants at the southwest border in March, the most in any month for at least 15 years and up nearly 70 percent from February, as thousands of children remained backed up in detention facilities and border agents released an increasing number of migrant families into the United States, government documents obtained by The New York Times show.,More than 18,700 unaccompanied children and teenagers were taken into custody last month after crossing the border, including at port entries, nearly double the roughly 9,450 minors detained in February and more than four times the 4,635 unaccompanied minors who crossed in March of last year, the documents show.,The sharp increases underscored the political and logistical challenges to the administration of managing the flow of people coming from Central America, including the need to more quickly move unaccompanied children and teenagers into emergency shelters at military sites and conventions centers throughout the United States. Many of the children are seeking to join parents, relatives or other people they know who are already in the country.,But the increasing number of family members traveling together is creating another issue for the administration. For much of the winter, even as the United States took in the unaccompanied minors, administration officials invoked an emergency rule put in place by the Trump administration during the pandemic to turn away most migrant families and single adults crossing the border.,The situation is rapidly becoming more complicated. For one thing, the sheer volume of families arriving is growing fast, with border officials encountering more than 53,000 migrants traveling as families in March, more than double the roughly 19,250 in the prior month.,American officials are also coping with a change in the law in Mexico, which has tightened its conditions for accepting Central American families expelled by the United States. Because of the new law in Mexico and a lack of space in shelters there for children, the United States can no longer send most families with a child under the age of 7 back across the border.,At the same time, the United States does not currently have the capacity to detain large numbers of families, leaving border officials with few options other than to release them with orders to appear in the future to have their cases heard.,“We’re entering phase two of this extraordinary migration event,” said Cris Ramón, an immigration consultant based in Washington. “At this point, the scope of the individuals who are coming means the administration is going to have to now address the challenges of not only building capacity for unaccompanied children, but they’re going to have to expand this capacity for families.”,The overcrowding in facilities has prompted border agents to release more families into communities along the border, according to officials. Some of those who have been released were not fully informed about the details of their upcoming court appearances, those officials said.,Authorities have dropped off families with children at bus stations in border communities, where they then continue their journeys north to relatives in the United States. Border officials encountered more than 1,360 migrants traveling as part of families on Sunday and expelled just 219, according to the documents. On March 26, more than 2,100 families were detained and just 200 were turned back south.,“We are seeing the numbers increase day by day. They increased tremendously, especially in March,” said Hugo Zurita, the executive director of Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, which has been providing hot meals and items, such as clothing, hand sanitizer and masks, to migrant families at the city’s bus station.,Republican members of Congress, vowing to make the issue central to their efforts to retake control of Congress, have repeatedly accused the administration of encouraging the surge in migration with President Biden’s pledge to have more compassionate policies toward migrants than those imposed under President Donald J. Trump.,“They’re certainly going to be using this as a weapon against us,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. “It’s taking away from Biden’s good work. He’s done a hell of a job on vaccines. It’s taken us away from the messaging we’ve had.”,The Biden administration has continued to use a pandemic-emergency rule to rapidly expel single adults, who continued to make up the majority of those caught at the border in March. Advocates for immigrants have criticized the rule as breaking with immigration laws that say migrants are entitled to apply for asylum upon reaching U.S. soil.,The White House has talked to at least one member of Congress about the possibility of expelling 16 and 17-year-olds to Mexico, according to a person familiar with the discussions.,The administration has also framed its response as focused on tackling the root causes of migration, appointing Vice President Kamala Harris to work with leaders in the region to bolster the economy in Central America and restarting ,that allows some children to apply in their home region for permission to live in the United States with a parent or other relative.,“We are not naïve about the challenge but what our focus is on is solutions and actions to help address the unaccompanied minors who are coming across the border and making it less of an incentive to come,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Friday.,The crossings by unaccompanied minors present the more severe logistical challenge for Mr. Biden. Unlike single adults or migrants traveling as a family, the administration by law is responsible for the care of unaccompanied children and teenagers until it can match them with a sponsor in the United States.,Nearly 5,000 children and teenagers were in detention centers that were originally set up to hold adults on Thursday, including more than 3,300 held longer than the maximum 72 hours allowed under federal law, according to government documents. Within 72 hours, they are supposed to be transferred to the shelter system run by the Department of Health and Human Services.,More than 13,300 minors were held in the shelter system on Friday, according to the department. The administration is projecting it will need more than 35,000 beds for minors in border facilities and emergency shelters by the end of May, according to documents.,Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, said last month that the administration was expecting this year to encounter the most migrants at the border in 20 years.,“There’s no break on this,” said Ronald D. Vitiello, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and chief of the Border Patrol under the Trump administration. “It just gets a lot worse. It’s really unfortunate.”,Mr. Biden has now deployed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to find additional shelter space for the minors in an effort called “Operation Apollo.” The administration is still assessing housing migrants at new facilities at a hotel in Dallas, Fort Benning in Georgia and the Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento, according to government documents.,“They should’ve been planning for this a month ago,” Mr. Ramón said. “Now they have to be thinking two or three months ahead to have a solution to deal with this.”,Eileen Sullivan, contributed reporting from Washington, and ,Miriam Jordan, from Los Angeles."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/us/politics/supreme-court-religion.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — “For many today, religious liberty is not a cherished freedom,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. ,, the conservative legal group, in November. “It pains me to say this, but, in certain quarters, religious liberty is fast becoming a disfavored right.”,Those quarters do not include the Supreme Court, which has become far more likely to rule in favor of religious rights in recent years, according to , that considered 70 years of data.,The study, to be published in The Supreme Court Review, documented a 35-percentage-point increase in the rate of rulings in favor of religion in orally argued cases, culminating in an 81 percent success rate in the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.,“Plainly, the Roberts court has ruled in favor of religious organizations, including mainstream Christian organizations, more frequently than its predecessors,” wrote the study’s authors, Lee Epstein of Washington University in St. Louis and Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago. “With the replacement of Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Amy Coney Barrett, this trend will not end soon and may accelerate.”,(The court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, from 1953 to 1969, supported religion just 46 percent of the time. That grew to 51 percent under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, from 1969 to 1986; then to 58 percent under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, from 1986 to 2005; and finally jumped to just over 81 percent under Chief Justice Roberts, who joined the court in 2005.),The kinds of cases the court is hearing have changed, too. In the Warren court, all of the rulings in favor of religion benefited minority or dissenting practitioners. In the Roberts court, most of the religious claims were brought by mainstream Christians.,The five most pro-religion justices all sit on the current court, the study found.,“The justices who are largely responsible for this shift are Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh,” the study’s authors wrote. “While there are some differences among these justices, and Kavanaugh has been involved in only a handful cases, they are clearly the most pro-religion justices on the Supreme Court going back at least until World War II.” All are Republican appointees.,In the last term alone, the court sided with Christian religious groups in three argued cases. The court ruled that state programs supporting private schools ,, that the Trump administration could allow employers with religious objections , to female workers and that , to many teachers at religious schools.,And the court , whether Philadelphia may bar a Catholic agency that refused to work with same-sex couples from screening potential foster parents.,After Justice Barrett joined the court, , on the one question on which religious groups had been losing: whether governors could restrict attendance in houses of worship to address the coronavirus pandemic.,There has been a similar shift in the entire federal judiciary in cases on the constitutional protection of the free exercise of religion.,Protecting that right, as Justice Alito pointed out in his speech, used to be a bipartisan commitment. In 1990, when the Supreme Court ,, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing the majority opinion, Congress responded with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.,“The law had almost universal support,” Justice Alito said. “In the House, the vote was unanimous. In the Senate, it was merely 97 to 3, and the bill was enthusiastically signed by President Clinton.”,Earlier studies, , and ,, found that judges’ partisan affiliations, as reflected by political parties of the presidents who appointed them, were not significantly tied to their votes in free exercise cases.,Zalman Rothschild, a fellow at the Stanford Constitutional Law Center, , in a second study, to be published in The Cornell Law Review. He found that things had changed.,“The politicization of religious freedom has infiltrated every level of the federal judiciary,” Mr. Rothschild wrote.,In the five years through the end of 2020, he wrote, federal judges’ partisan affiliations had become powerfully correlated to their votes. “And when the pandemic struck, resulting in widespread lockdowns of religious houses of worship,” he wrote, “the unprecedented number of constitutional free exercise cases brought in such a condensed span of time forced that partisanship into sharp relief.”,Even putting aside cases concerning the pandemic, a big partisan gap has opened in free exercise cases. Judges appointed by Democrats sided with religion 10 percent of the time in such cases in the last five years, compared with 49 percent for ones appointed by Republicans and 72 percent for ones named by President Donald J. Trump.,The numbers were even starker, Mr. Rothschild wrote, in cases concerning restrictions meant to combat Covid-19. Through the end of last year, not a single judge appointed by Democrats sided with religion in those cases, while 66 percent of judges appointed by Republicans and 82 percent of judges appointed by Mr. Trump did.,What changed in just the last five years? It is probably no coincidence that , in 2015.,More generally, claims of religious freedom, brought mostly by Christian groups, have increasingly been used to try to limit progressive measures like the protection of transgender rights and access to contraception. On top of that, a culture war erupted about how best to address the coronavirus.,In 2018, Justice Elena Kagan accused the court’s conservative majority of “,,” of using its protection of free expression “to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.”,Professor Epstein said something similar was afoot in the court’s religion decisions. “Just as the majority has weaponized free speech in service of business and conservative interests,” she said, “it’s using the religion clauses to privilege mostly mainstream religious organizations.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-twitter.html,politics,"The Supreme Court on Monday vacated an appeals court ruling that President Donald J. Trump had violated the First Amendment by blocking people from his Twitter account after they posted critical comments.,A unanimous three-judge panel of the appeals court , that Mr. Trump’s account was a public forum from which he was powerless to exclude people based on their viewpoints.,The Supreme Court’s move was expected, as Mr. Trump is no longer president and Twitter has , his account.,More surprising was , from Justice Clarence Thomas musing on what he called the dangerous power a few private companies have over free speech.,“Today’s digital platforms provide avenues for historically unprecedented amounts of speech, including speech by government actors,” he wrote. “Also unprecedented, however, is the concentrated control of so much speech in the hands of a few private parties. We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms.”,No other justice joined the opinion, and Justice Thomas’s views on the First Amendment can be idiosyncratic. But his opinion reflected widespread frustration, particularly among conservatives, about letting private companies decide what the public may read and see.,The appeals court “feared that then-President Trump cut off speech by using the features that Twitter made available to him,” Justice Thomas wrote. “But if the aim is to ensure that speech is not smothered, then the more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/us/winfred-rembert-dead.html,arts,"Winfred Rembert survived a near-lynching in rural Georgia in 1967. Just 21, he had been stripped of his clothes by a mob of white men and hoisted upside down from a tree, a noose around his ankles. One man came at him with a knife and nearly castrated him, sending blood gushing down his body.,The only reason he wasn’t killed was that another white man stepped in, saying there were better things that could be done with Mr. Rembert, like throwing him back in jail from which he had just escaped.,After seven years of incarceration and hard labor for stealing a car, taking a gun from a deputy sheriff and escaping from prison, Mr. Rembert was released. He married, moved north and the couple had eight children. And in a turn of events that no one had expected, he became ,: Carving figures into leather, a craft he had learned in prison, he recreated vivid scenes from his life, of picking cotton, being lynched and busting rocks in his prison stripes.,His art told the story of the Jim Crow South. It was exhibited in galleries and museums and helped support his family, though they lived in poverty.,Mr. Rembert died at 75 on Wednesday at his home in New Haven, Conn. His son Winfred Jr. said that the precise cause of death was not known, but that his father had struggled with diabetes, kidney disease and hypertension.,Near-lynchings were not uncommon, ,, a Black lawyer who inspired the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, a museum about, in Montgomery, Ala., said in a phone interview. What was unusual in Mr. Rembert’s case was that he talked about it, providing a rare account of a lynching in the late 1960s in the American South.,“Most people don’t ever feel secure enough to talk about this, although we’re hearing more of these stories now,” said Mr. Stevenson, who founded the ,, a legal advocacy group that works to end mass incarceration. “But Winfred was such a compelling storyteller, his personal narrative always included this, and he was able to talk about it in a direct way.”,Mr. Rembert was 19 and working in a pool hall when he went to a demonstration in 1965 in Americus, Ga., as part of the ,, a local civil rights campaign. When the protest turned violent, he was chased down an alley by two white men with shotguns.,As he was being pursued, by his account, he saw a parked car with the keys in it, jumped in and drove off. He was later caught and sent to jail.,Still in jail more than a year later, with no charges filed against him, he rebelled by stuffing the toilet in his cell with toilet paper so that it would overflow. A deputy sheriff entered the cell, the two scuffled and the deputy pulled his gun. Mr. Rembert wrested the gun away, locked the deputy in the cell and fled.,When the authorities caught up with him, they put him in the trunk of a police car and drove to the countryside outside of his hometown, Cuthbert, in southwest Georgia. They opened the trunk and let him out.,“I saw all of these white people, and I see these ropes hanging in the tree,”,. “They took off all of my clothes, put the noose around my ankles, and they drew me up in this tree.”,He thought his life was over.,“The next thing I see was the deputy sheriff, who I had locked in the cell,” he said. “He took his knife, grabbed my private parts, and he stuck me with the blade. You could probably hear me for miles screaming” as the blood ran down.,“And then from out of the blue, this man said: ‘Don’t do that. We got better things we can do’” with him, using a racist slur.,Mr. Rembert spent the next seven years being rotated through different prisons, working on chain gangs. He was also paraded through Cuthbert’s Black neighborhood in shackles as an example to others not to mess with the white power structure.,That his near-lynching happened in 1967 and not 20 years earlier is probably what saved his life, Mr. Stevenson said, because “by then, the mobs didn’t have the same confidence that they could engage in these lawless killings with impunity.” Although the Justice Department was starting to investigate such crimes, he said, no one was ever held accountable for Mr. Rembert’s torture.,In time, Mr. Rembert turned his raw experience into art. But though he was celebrated for it and earned some money from it, dwelling on his past sometimes made him physically ill.,“Now I’m 71,” he told StoryCorps 50 years after he had been hanged by his ankles, “but I still wake up screaming and reliving things that happened to me.”,He had been seeing a psychiatrist, “but I don’t think I’ll ever get over that,” he said, his voice cracking. “I think I’ll be dead and in my grave before it’s over.”,Winfred Rembert was born in Americus on Nov. 22, 1945. “My mom cheated on her husband, and I was the product of that,” he said in a documentary film, , (2011). When he was three months old, his mother gave him to her aunt, Lillian Rembert, who lived in Cuthbert and worked the cotton fields. Rows and rows of white cotton would figure prominently in Mr. Rembert’s leather artwork.,When he was on the chain gang, working on a road crew, a young woman, Patsy Gammage, caught his eye. He managed to start a correspondence with her, and they married after he was released from prison in 1974. They migrated north — first to Rochester, N.Y., then to Connecticut, where Mr. Rembert found work as a longshoreman in Bridgeport. They settled in New Haven in 1987.,He had always liked to draw. While in prison, he had learned how to work in leather using tools and dyes, and he started making small items like billfolds.,He gave a small leather picture to his friends Philip and Sharon McBlain, and they hung it on the wall of their antiquarian bookshop near New Haven. Mr. Rembert had traced the picture from a book because he didn’t think white people would buy his own work, Mr. McBlain said in an interview.,But the piece sold for $300. Mr. McBlain gave the money to Mr. Rembert, who created a bigger picture, which sold for $750. The McBlains got him some leather and tools, and Mr. Rembert’s wife urged him to carve pictures from his own life.,At 51, he started excavating his memories. With blades of ivory and a mallet, he reproduced — in painstaking detail — his near-lynching and gangs of prisoners in their zebra-striped uniforms with sledgehammers and shovels.,He showed lively scenes of the juke joints and pool halls of his hometown. And he showed personally painful scenes, like a classroom with all the children at their desks except for him: He was assigned to keep the potbelly stove filled with wood. He never learned to read or write until he got to prison.,He soon had a solo show, at the York Square Cinema in New Haven in 1998. Other , — at the Yale University Art Gallery and in Harlem, Atlanta, Los Angeles and elsewhere. At the Adelson Galleries in Manhattan in 2010, some pieces sold for $35,000 each. Perhaps the highest price he fetched was close to $80,000, for one of his chain gang images.,In addition to his wife and his son Winfred Jr., Mr. Rembert is survived by two daughters, Lillian and Nancy Rembert; four other sons, John, Mitchell and Patrick Rembert and Robby Nuñez; and 17 grandchildren. Another son, Edgar, died of a heart problem in 2015.,As his artwork brought him more attention, his hometown, Cuthbert, invited him back in 2011. The mayor declared “Winfred Rembert Day.”,He was also , in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Americus movement, where Mr. Rembert’s own odyssey had begun. There he met former President Jimmy Carter, who lived in nearby Plains. Mr. Rembert was thrilled.,“It was important for him to go back and be recognized in Georgia as somebody who had lived a worthy life, not a nobody who had left in chains,” said Erin I. Kelly, who collaborated with Mr. Rembert on his forthcoming memoir, “Chasing Me to My Grave: An Artist’s Memoir of the Jim Crow South.”,“That trip,” she said, “was part of a larger story of him going home, sharing his art and the story of his life and being recognized.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/us/politics/biden-hunger-programs.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — With more than one in 10 households reporting that they lack enough to eat, the Biden administration is accelerating a vast campaign of hunger relief that will temporarily increase assistance by tens of billions of dollars and set the stage for what officials envision as lasting expansions of aid.,The effort to rush more food assistance to more people is notable both for the scale of its ambition and the variety of its legislative and administrative actions. The campaign has increased food stamps by more than $1 billion a month, provided needy children a dollar a day for snacks, expanded a produce allowance for pregnant women and children, and authorized the largest children’s summer feeding program in history.,“We haven’t seen an expansion of food assistance of this magnitude since the founding of the modern food stamp program in 1977,” said James P. Ziliak, an economist at the University of Kentucky who studies nutrition programs. “It’s a profound change.”,While dollars and decisions are flowing from the Agriculture Department, the tone has been set by President Biden, who issued , in January telling aides to “address the growing hunger crisis” and later lamented the car lines “half a mile each, just to get a box of food.”,The push reflects an extraordinary shift in the politics of poverty — driven, paradoxically, both by the spread of hardship to more working-class and white families and the growing recognition of poverty’s disproportionate toll on minorities. With hunger especially pronounced among Black and Latino households, vital to the Democrats’ coalition, the administration is framing its efforts not just as a response to pandemic needs but as part of a campaign for racial justice.,“This crisis has revealed how fragile many Americans’ economic lives are and also the inequities of who is struggling the most,” said Stacy Dean, who is leading the effort as a senior official at the Agriculture Department after a prominent career as an anti-hunger advocate. “It’s an incredibly painful picture, and it is even more so for communities of color.”,Like other policies being pursued by the White House — including a temporary child allowance that is expected to cut child poverty , — the effort to reduce hunger reflects a new willingness among Democrats to embrace an identity as poverty fighters that they once feared would alienate the middle class.,To understand what the new policies mean at the kitchen table, consider the experience of Dakota Kirby, 29, a single mother in Indianapolis who lost her job as a caregiver for an elderly woman at the start of the pandemic. Having recently started the job, Ms. Kirby assumed she could not get unemployment benefits and did not apply.,That left her relying on nutritional aid and a trickle of child support to feed a 6-year-old daughter and a year-old son.,“It got a little rough there,” said Ms. Kirby, adding that she hesitates to complain since “there’s families that have it way worse.”,Even when she budgeted carefully, her $509 a month in food stamps ran out within three weeks. She trimmed her portions and skipped meals, so the children could eat. She got help from a food bank until her children rebelled at butter beans and tuna. She pawned her television set, but still came up short at the checkout line.,“It was humiliating,” she said, to jettison frozen pizzas in line as strangers looked on. “I’ve never had that kind of problem. It makes you really sad and angry as a mom. Especially when it’s through no fault of your own.”,Ms. Kirby recently received a 15 percent increase in food stamps, mandated by Congress in December, which was so unexpected she refused to spend it, for fear she would get in trouble.,In addition, both children will now qualify for , which offers electronic vouchers for groceries to replace meals lost during school closings. (Previously only her older child qualified.) And she will receive more money for produce under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.,Combined, monthly aid from the three programs will rise to $930 from $665. Put differently, each person in the home will now receive $10 a day to eat, an increase of 40 percent.,“That’s a big old jump!” she said, surprised at the news. “It will help tremendously.”,The Biden effort marks a sharp change from the philosophy of the Trump administration, which sought to narrow eligibility for food stamps and expand work rules.,So far, the expansion of aid has brought only modest conservative complaint. But what supporters called “nutritional assistance,” critics often call “welfare.” Past expansions of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as the food stamp program is formally known, brought counterattacks from conservatives who argued that the program undercut work and marriage.,Angela Rachidi of the conservative American Enterprise Institute said the Biden administration had ,. She noted that the government had spent vast sums to expand other programs and that Congress had substantially raised SNAP benefits for many families at the start of the pandemic. (In addition to increased SNAP, Ms. Kirby received $8,200 in stimulus payments and will get a $6,600 child allowance.),Ms. Rachidi credited strict welfare rules for ,— child poverty fell to a record low — and warned that a lasting aid expansion would put that progress at risk.,“This has been on the agenda of Democrats and left-leaning advocacy groups for a long time — they’re expanding programs that discourage work and encourage dependency,” she said. “There’s a clear intention to make these changes permanent, and I think many Republicans have been asleep at the wheel.”,Scenes of crowded food banks have provided some of the most arresting images of the pandemic and brought hunger issues a rare spotlight. A recent , found that, over the previous week alone, 8.4 percent of adults said their households “sometimes” lacked enough to eat and 2.3 percent said they “often” did. That translates into 23 million hungry adults, plus millions of children., complicate prepandemic comparisons, though multiple , hunger levels ,.,At the John Boner Neighborhood Center in Indianapolis, requests for emergency food have become so common that the agency has started to stock food boxes.,“We have people who’ve never needed assistance before, and we have that population that needed it before but need it more now,” said Carla James, a staff member.,Interviews with neighborhood residents suggest the aid expansions have done much to reduce hardship, but with their reach varying greatly from household to household.,While Ms. Kirby got no unemployment aid, Sonya Radford quickly received jobless benefits, which more than replaced the income she lost when her job as a nursing assistant ended, and she enrolled in SNAP. That combination left her better able to feed her three children than before the pandemic, when she often relied on food pantries.,“With the benefits, we’re pretty well off,” she said.,Anna Chaney quit her job as a Door Dash driver to watch her daughter and two grandchildren when their schools closed. She has since seen both hardship and plenty. For seven months, surviving on SNAP was such a struggle that she cut portions and diluted the chicken soup. Then she suddenly got $16,000 in overdue unemployment benefits. She filled the freezer with meat and took the family on vacation.,“I wish that the lawmakers would have realized prior to us being in a pandemic that poor people needed more,” she said. “It took more of the middle class, and some of the upper class, to find that they needed help for people to act. For me to go in and tell the Indiana legislature, ‘Hey, guys, $75 isn’t enough to eat for a week,’ that’s going to be a real hard sell. But when the whole world is suffering, that’s a different situation.”,The Biden administration shares the hope — that , expansions, most of them temporary, will lead to permanent change. “We can build a stronger, longer-lasting safety net,” Ms. Dean said.,Speaking at an anti-hunger conference last month, the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, outlined a kaleidoscope of recent initiatives. They include new subsidies to food banks, an outreach campaign in WIC, food aid for homeless young adults, grants for Puerto Rico and the Mariana Islands, and efforts to deliver more nutritious food.,Perhaps the most important change since the start of the pandemic involves the temporary growth of SNAP benefits, which reach about one in eight Americans and one in four children.,The Biden administration , last week that will further raise benefits beyond those Democrats twice pushed through Congress last year. A federal judge ruled last fall that the Trump administration had erred in denying the poorest 40 percent of households the initial increase; in agreeing to raise those benefits, the Biden administration officials will expand assistance by more than a $1 billion a month.,With the new increase, average benefits will have grown temporarily by roughly three-quarters during the crisis.,Pandemic-EBT, the replacement for school meals, is a large temporary program that could lead to lasting change. Child hunger routinely rises when schools let out, and nutrition advocates have long called for a large summer feeding program. By extending Pandemic-EBT through the summer, Congress is essentially running a pilot program, at a cost of roughly $6 billion, and Biden officials have signaled an interest in making it permanent.,Less immediate but potentially of great importance is a process the Biden team has started to re-examine adequacy of SNAP benefits in normal times. The benefits are based on a budget called the Thrifty Food Plan, which experts have long argued underestimates the costs of feeding a family. Elaine Waxman of the Urban Institute and two colleagues found , (or $15 billion a year in pre-crisis terms) to meet minimal needs.,In 2018, Congress, then under Republican control, authorized the Agriculture Department to re-evaluate the cost of a healthy diet, and Mr. Biden’s order urged officials to accelerate the work. While awaiting an internal study, officials have indicated they expect to raise benefits significantly.,“The Thrifty Food Plan is just too thrifty,” Ms. Dean recently said.,Speaking at the recent conference, Mr. Vilsack cast these efforts as part of a fight for racial justice. A former agriculture secretary under President Barack Obama, he called himself an “older white guy” and added, “I haven’t had the experience of being Black.” But he said an equity commission in the department would re-evaluate policies to ensure racial fairness.,Reassured by a reporter that her benefit increase had not been a mistake, Ms. Kirby, the Indianapolis mother, recently returned to the grocery store where her shortage of funds had led to humiliation in the checkout line.,This time, she brought her children, no longer afraid they would ask for food she could not afford. She bought the frozen pizzas she had been forced to discard in the earlier visit and “some expensive stuff, like meat sauce for spaghetti.”,“I don’t even know how to explain it,” referring to her eased worries. “It’s like a physical relief. I just knew everything would be OK.”"

Reading from an , where Spears wrote, “Who else finds the sea more mysterious than space?” Fineman asked, “Who do they think is writing my account? Jacques Cousteau?”,The show’s first guest was the rapper Lil Nas X (Chris Redd), who has been , after putting out a racy video for his single “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” and limited-edition Nike sneakers called ,Asked about the criticism and a lawsuit from Nike that followed the release of the shoes, Redd said, “Their whole thing is just do it. Well, I did it.”,As for the detractors of the music video — in which Lil Nas X is seen giving a lap dance to Satan — Redd described them as “closed-minded idiots.” He added, “People are afraid of me because I’m different but really I’m just your typical gay Black country rap sneaker entrepreneur.”,The show’s next guest was the Looney Tunes cartoon character Pepé Le Pew, played by Kate McKinnon who was wearing a skunk costume and wielding a cigarette holder.,McKinnon lamented the fact that , and told Fineman, “I would kiss you all the way up your arm but I realize that’s no longer socially acceptable.”,McKinnon, in her skunk outfit, explained that career options for Le Pew were limited.,“I would love to be at a point in my career where I can turn down projects but there’s not a lot of parts for old French skunks,” she said. “Every audition comes down to me or Gérard Depardieu.”,Fineman introduced her last guest — “As we’d say in the early 2000s a hot mess and as we’d say today, a full-on sex pest,” she said — Representative Matt Gaetz, played by Pete Davidson.,“My name is Matt Gaetz, like Bill Gates but with a Z at the end,” Davidson said. “Like a cool version for teens.”,Fineman recounted several recent scandals involving Gaetz, including , into whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him, and , he’d had sex with to other lawmakers.,“Which is not a crime,” Davidson said of that last account. “Just horrifying.”,Fineman responded, “I think I can spot a teen predator when I see one. After all I was on ‘Mickey Mouse Club.’”,Davidson said he was not that different from Pepé Le Pew, arguing, “I’m just a ladies’ man.”,With some revulsion, McKinnon replied, “Dude, no. I am a cartoon skunk — you are a United States congressman. Be better, OK?”,This week’s host, ,, is a star of films like “Get Out” and , for his performance in “Judas and the Black Messiah.” Still, he knew his natural speaking voice would come as a surprise to some viewers.,As he told the “S.N.L.” audience in his opening monologue, “First of all, I know you’re hearing my accent and thinking, oh no, he’s not Black — he’s British. Let me reassure you that I am Black. I’m Black and I’m British. Basically, I’m what the Royal Family was worried the baby would look like.”,He also revisited his victory at the Golden Globes ceremony in February, ,. “I was muted, can you believe that?” Kaluuya said. “I told the best joke of my life and I was muted. I felt like I was in ,.”,“S.N.L.” has a proud tradition of sketches centered on fake game shows and, more recently, on , with ,.,“Will You Take It?” is a fine entry in this growing subgenre: Kaluuya played its host, a fictional doctor trying to convince four members of his extended family (Redd, Ego Nwodim, Kenan Thompson and Punkie Johnson) that they all need to get Covid vaccinations. He reminded Redd that he is a diabetic who has been shot in the lung, but Redd remained reluctant because, as he said, “I never get sick ’cause I sleep in my socks.”,In a further exchange, Redd said he would receive a vaccine “when white people start taking it.” Told that white people have already been getting vaccinated, Redd replied, “Man, you can’t trust white people.”,Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on Matt Gaetz and on ,.,Jost began:,Che continued:"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html,politics,"Go page by page through ,, and one takeaway stands above all others: The Republican legislature and governor have made ,, making absentee voting harder and creating restrictions and complications in the wake of narrow losses to Democrats.,The New York Times has examined and annotated the law, identifying 16 provisions that hamper the right to vote for some Georgians or strip power from state and local elections officials and give it to legislators.,Republicans passed and signed the , last week following the first Democratic victories in presidential and Senate elections in Georgia in a generation. President Biden won the state by , out of nearly five million cast. The new law will, in particular, curtail ballot access for voters in booming urban and suburban counties, home to many Democrats. Another provision makes it a crime to offer water to voters waiting in lines, which tend to be longer in densely populated communities.,Below is The Times’s analysis of the law, including the specific provisions and some struck-through language from the state’s previous voting legislation.,Georgia has cut by more than half the period during which voters may request an absentee ballot, from nearly six months before an election to less than three.,This will almost certainly reduce the number of people who seek absentee ballots and the number of people who vote. ,, 1.3 million Georgians — about 26 percent of the state’s electorate — voted with absentee ballots. Of those who returned absentee ballots in 2020, 65 percent voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 34 percent chose Donald J. Trump.,The shorter window will also limit opportunities for get-out-the-vote efforts and could put greater strain on local election boards, which will have less time to process ballot requests.,Previously, Georgia law required voters to simply sign their absentee ballot applications. Now they will have to provide the number from a driver’s license or an equivalent state-issued identification. This is virtually certain to limit access to absentee voting.,The law also creates pitfalls for voters: If they fail to follow all the new steps, like printing a date of birth or in some cases including partial Social Security numbers, their ballots could be tossed out. Mr. Trump’s lawyers and allies urged judges and Republican officials last year to invalidate some ballots that were out of compliance. Stringent voter-ID laws in other states have depressed voting mostly among people of color.,When the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, mailed absentee ballot applications to every registered voter in the state ahead of its June primary election. This led to absentee voting by record numbers of Georgians.,When Mr. Raffensperger didn’t mail applications again for the general election, several local government agencies did so, particularly in Georgia’s large urban counties — a move that the state has now made illegal. With the loss of automatically mailed applications, some voters will invariably not request ballots, since the applications also served as a reminder to people that they were eligible to vote.,The new law also forbids third-party groups to prefill applications for voters, which made applying for an absentee ballot easier for many voters.,For the 2020 election, there were 94 drop boxes across the four counties that make up the core of metropolitan Atlanta: Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett. The new law limits the same four counties to a total of, at most, 23 drop boxes, based on ,. The number could be lower depending on how many early-voting sites the counties provide.,There won’t just be fewer drop boxes. Instead of 24-hour access outdoors, the boxes must be placed indoors at government buildings and early-voting sites and will thus be unavailable for voters to drop off their ballots during evenings and other nonbusiness hours.,The measure is likely to have the effect of pushing absentee voters to return ballots through the mail, which in 2020 , as in the past because of cuts to the Postal Service.,Last year, Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, had , during the early voting periods, effectively bringing polling sites to people at churches, parks and public libraries. In the November election, more than 11,200 people voted at the two vehicles in Fulton County.,Georgia has now outlawed this practice, unless the governor declares a state of emergency to allow it — something that Mr. Kemp, a Republican, is unlikely to do given that it could increase voter turnout in Atlanta.,These new strict rules on early voting hours are likely to curtail voting access for Georgians who work daytime hours or have less flexible schedules and who may be unable to return an absentee ballot.,The provision requires counties to hold early voting during weekday working hours — 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — and says it may be held for longer but may not take place before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on those days. The early voting period will begin four weeks before an election. The previous iteration of the law called only for early voting during “normal business hours” and left it up to counties to determine those hours.,The provision also adds a second required Saturday of early voting (the previous law required only one), which will increase access to early voting in most of the state’s rural counties, where election administrators have often been short-staffed and have offered fewer hours of early voting. Most larger counties in the state already offered multiple weekend days of early voting.,The law doesn’t require the availability of early voting on Sundays, which means that counties can choose whether to open for early voting on up to two Sundays before an election.,Counties that choose not to open on Sundays would be limiting ballot access for parishioners at Black churches that have , after Sunday services.,Perhaps no provision in the Georgia law has received more attention than this one, which effectively bars third-party groups or anyone else who is not an election worker from providing food and water to voters waiting in line. Republicans defended the provision, saying it is enforceable only within a 150-foot radius of polling places. Civil rights groups note that it also prevents assistance “within 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote at any polling place.”,Long lines for voting in Georgia are an unfortunate reality, and are often found in the poorer, densely populated communities that tend to vote Democratic. During the primary election last June, when temperatures hovered above 80 degrees with high humidity, multiple voting locations across the state ,.,Numerous studies have shown that long lines deter people from voting. According to ,, an independent research group, over 560,000 voters did not cast ballots in 2016 “because of problems related to polling place management, including long lines.” In 2014, Stephen Pettigrew, then a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s department of government, , found that more than 200,000 voters did not vote in the midterm elections that year because they had faced long lines during the 2012 election.,The new law does make it clear that it is legal for voters to drink from a water fountain, if one exists along the line to vote and provided they get the water themselves.,From 2012 to 2018, Georgia shuttered more than 214 voting precincts around the state, according to ,. Those changes, many of which followed the Supreme Court’s , in 2013, confused many voters, who upon showing up to the wrong precinct had to vote with provisional ballots.,This provision removes even that remedy for voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m., requiring them to instead travel to the correct precinct or risk being disenfranchised.,Casting a provisional ballot after showing up at the wrong precinct was by far the most common reason for voting provisionally in the 2020 election in Georgia; roughly 44 percent of provisional ballots in the state were from “out of precinct voters,” ,. And in Fulton County, , were from “out of precinct” voters.,Of the , that were counted in the 2020 presidential election, Mr. Biden won 64 percent and Mr. Trump took 34 percent.,This is a small change, but it could have a significant impact on whether voting hours can be extended in the event of a problem.,Previously, a judge could order that a precinct stay open for as long as necessary based on a problem that had hindered voting (for example, if power went out for 30 minutes, the judge could add an hour of balloting at the end of the day). The new provision requires any relief period to match exactly the amount of time that people were unable to vote.,Georgia is no stranger to Election Day mishaps and problems. Its primary last June was marred by hourslong lines caused by malfunctioning machines. Some precincts had no choice but to ask every voter to file a provisional ballot. Other precincts stayed open later into the night.,Under the new law, if similar election problems were to occur, voters who had to leave would have less time to come back later.,One key factor in how widely Mr. Trump and his allies were able to spread falsehoods about the 2020 election was that it took more than two weeks for news outlets to declare that President Biden had won Georgia. With such a long delay, Republicans successfully sowed doubts about the election’s validity by baselessly arguing that fraud must have taken place.,Georgia Republicans’ new voting law does allow the absentee ballot counting process to begin much earlier, with local clerks allowed to open and inspect absentee ballots three weeks before an election.,Still, no ballots can be counted until the polls close, meaning the process of tabulating and reporting vote totals is likely to be lengthy for high-turnout contests. That could lead future candidates to follow Mr. Trump’s lead in trying to contest the results of a legitimate election.,Last year, as election officials faced countless challenges trying to hold voting during a pandemic, funding for the November general election became tied up in , over the second stimulus package.,Many local election jurisdictions in Georgia and other states, particularly those in poorer urban areas, turned to outside philanthropic groups like the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit organization funded by Mark Zuckerberg that helped counties pay for their elections in 2020. Now Georgia has eliminated that option.,Conspiracy theories in right-wing circles have long focused on the specter of nefarious outsiders swaying election operations with donations; the theories often involve anti-Semitic falsehoods about George Soros, the billionaire liberal donor, who is also Jewish.,Complaints about possible voter intimidation and fraud had previously been run through a web of county election officials and the secretary of state before reaching the state attorney general, but this provision centralizes them and deputizes the attorney general to handle them.,Placing that responsibility within the attorney general’s office may help remove partisan influence to actions that are taken in response to complaints, but voting rights groups say it could serve as an intimidation tactic. And attorneys general themselves could bring their own partisan influence.,This is one of a few provisions that strip power from the secretary of state and indirectly shift it to the legislature by creating a new chair of the State Election Board. Previously, the secretary of state had served in that role.,The law dictates that the newly created chair be “nonpartisan,” but the position is appointed through the partisan legislature. Voting rights groups say this amounts to the legislature’s exerting more control over the State Election Board and election oversight in general.,The provision does contain some partisan guardrails: In the two years immediately preceding a chair’s appointment, he or she cannot have been a candidate for public office or have made any political campaign contributions.,But it also looks an awful lot like a revenge move: Republican lawmakers are taking power away from Mr. Raffensperger, who infuriated Mr. Trump and some G.O.P. leaders in the state by rebuffing the former president’s fraud claims.,This is a more direct attack on the powers of the secretary of state, effectively eliminating that person’s voice on the State Election Board.,Viewed through the lens of the 2020 election, this could be seen as revenge for Georgia Republicans against the current secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, who would not capitulate to Mr. Trump’s demands to overturn the results under a false banner of fraud.,Another power play by Republican state lawmakers. Tensions have long simmered between state and county election officials in Georgia, particularly in Fulton County, the largest Democratic hub in the state, where officials say they have been targeted and deprived of support by Republicans at the state level. Election officials in Fulton County, for their part, have had their historical share of mistakes and mismanagement.,Now the State Election Board, newly influenced by the partisan Legislature, will have the power to suspend county election officials. That part of the new law alarmed some Democratic legislators, who noted that it could particularly affect counties like Fulton, which contains 15 percent of those in the state who voted Democratic in the November election.,The law does state that the bar for suspension is high: either a minimum of three clear violations of State Election Board rules, or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections.,In the event of a suspension, the State Election Board would name a temporary replacement.,Georgia has had its fair share of runoff elections recently; both of its newly seated Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, prevailed in such contests. The shortening of the runoff election window, which Republicans say was meant to help election administrators, could also end up overburdening them, forcing a quick turnaround to hold a runoff election even as officials are still working to certify and ratify the initial general election vote.,Shortening the runoff time will also affect both early voting and military and overseas voters. While the bill states that early voting for a runoff should begin “as early as possible,” it does not specifically require weekend voting.,Additionally, federal election law states that ballots for military and overseas voters must be mailed out 45 days before an election, so those voters will now receive ranked-choice general-election ballots rather than second, separate ballots for the runoff."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html,business,"Until recently, Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out.,Mr. Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March, Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS, effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure, since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments, called derivatives, created by the banks.,That changed in late March, after shares of ViacomCBS fell precipitously and the lenders demanded their money. When Archegos couldn’t pay, they seized its assets and sold them off, leading to one of the biggest implosions of an investment firm since the 2008 financial crisis.,Almost overnight, Mr. Hwang’s personal wealth shriveled. It’s a tale as old as Wall Street itself, where the right combination of ambition, savvy and timing can generate fantastic profits — only to crumble in an instant when conditions change.,“That whole affair is indicative of the loose regulatory environment over the last several years,” said Charles Geisst, a historian of Wall Street. “Archegos was able to hide its identity from regulators by leveraging through banks in what has to be the best example of shadow trading.”,The meltdown of Mr. Hwang’s firm had ripple effects. Two of his bank lenders have revealed billions of dollars in losses. ViacomCBS saw its share price halved in a week. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened a preliminary inquiry into Archegos, two people familiar with the matter said, and market watchers are calling for tougher oversight of family offices like Mr. Hwang’s — private investment vehicles of the wealthy that are estimated to control several trillion dollars in assets. Others are calling for more transparency in the market for the kind of derivatives sold to Archegos.,Mr. Hwang declined to comment for this article.,His is a proverbial American rags-to-riches story. Born in South Korea, Mr. Hwang moved to Las Vegas in 1982 as a high school student. He spoke little English, and his first job was as a cook at a McDonald’s on the Strip. Within a year, his father, a pastor, had died. He and his mother moved to Los Angeles, where he studied economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, but found himself distracted by the excitement of nearby Santa Monica, Hollywood and Beverly Hills.,“I always blame people who set up U.C.L.A. in such a nice neighborhood,” he told congregants at Promise International Fellowship, a church in Flushing, Queens, ,. “I couldn’t go to school that much, to be honest.”,He graduated — barely, he said — and pursued a master of business administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then worked for about six years at a South Korean financial-services firm in New York, eventually landing a plum job as an investment adviser for Julian Robertson, the respected stock investor whose Tiger Management, founded in 1980, was considered a hedge fund pioneer.,After Mr. Robertson closed the New York fund to outside investors in 2000, he helped seed Mr. Hwang’s own hedge fund, Tiger Asia, which focused on Asian stocks and quickly grew, at one point managing $3 billion for outside investors.,Mr. Hwang was known for swinging big. He made large, concentrated bets on shares in South Korea, Japan, China and elsewhere, using ample amounts of borrowed money — or leverage — that could both supercharge his returns or, in turn, wipe out his positions.,He was more modest in his personal life. The house that he and his wife, Becky, bought in Tenafly N.J., an upscale suburb, is valued at about $3 million — humble by Wall Street standards. A religious man, Mr. Hwang established the ,, a New York-based nonprofit that sponsors Bible readings and religious book clubs, growing it to $500 million in assets from $70 million in under a decade. The foundation has donated tens of millions of dollars to Christian organizations.,“He’s giving ridiculous amounts,” said John Bai, a co-founder and managing partner of the equity research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, who has known Mr. Hwang for roughly three decades. “But he’s doing it in a very unassuming, humble, non-boastful way.”,But in his investing approach, he embraced risk and his firm ran afoul of regulators. In 2008, Tiger Asia lost money when the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy at the peak of the financial crisis. The next year, Hong Kong regulators accused the fund of , it had received to trade some Chinese stocks.,In 2012, Mr. Hwang reached a civil settlement with U.S. securities regulators in a separate insider trading investigation and was fined ,. That same year, Tiger Asia pleaded guilty to federal insider-trading charges in the same investigation and returned money to its investors. Mr. Hwang was barred from managing public money for at least five years. Regulators formally ,Shortly after shuttering Tiger Asia, Mr. Hwang opened Archegos, named after the Greek word for leader or prince. The new firm, which also invested in both U.S. and Asian stocks, was similar to a hedge fund, but its assets were made up entirely of Mr. Hwang’s personal wealth and that of certain family members. The arrangement shielded Archegos from regulatory scrutiny because of its lack of public investors.,Goldman Sachs, which had lent to him at Tiger Asia, initially refused to deal with Archegos. JPMorgan Chase, another “prime broker,” or large lender to trading firms, also stayed away. But as the firm grew, eventually reaching more than $10 billion in assets, according to someone familiar with the size of its holdings, its lure became irresistible. Archegos was trading stocks on two continents, and banks could charge sizable fees on the trades they helped arrange.,Goldman later changed course, and in 2020 became a prime broker to the firm alongside Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley. Nomura also worked with him. JPMorgan refused.,By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu.,Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, people familiar with his trading said, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns — but not the actual ownership — of the stock.,By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according to those people and a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out.,On Monday, March 22, , plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal it hoped would generate $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans. Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares, four people involved with the offering said.,But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. His decision caused the ViacomCBS fund-raising effort to end with $2.65 billion in new capital, significantly short of the original target.,ViacomCBS executives hadn’t known of Mr. Hwang’s enormous influence on the company’s share price, nor that he had canceled plans to invest in the share offering, until after it was completed, two people close to ViacomCBS said. They were frustrated to hear of it, the people said. At the same time, investors who had received larger-than-expected stakes in the new share offering and had seen it fall short, were selling the stock, driving its price down even further. (Morgan Stanley declined to comment.),By Thursday, March 25, Archegos was in critical condition. ViacomCBS’s plummeting stock price was setting off “margin calls,” or demands for additional cash or assets, from its prime brokers that the firm couldn’t fully meet. Hoping to buy time, Archegos called a meeting with its lenders, asking for patience as it unloaded assets quietly, a person close to the firm said.,Those hopes were dashed. Sensing imminent failure, Goldman began selling Archegos’s assets the next morning, followed by Morgan Stanley, to recoup their money. Other banks soon followed.,As ViacomCBS shares flooded onto the market that Friday because of the banks’ enormous sales, Mr. Hwang’s wealth plummeted. Credit Suisse, which had acted too slowly to stanch the damage, announced the possibility of significant losses; Nomura announced as much as $2 billion in losses. Goldman finished unwinding its position but did not record a loss, a person familiar with the matter said. ViacomCBS shares are down more than 50 percent since hitting their peak on March 22.,Mr. Hwang has laid low, issuing only a short statement calling this a “challenging time” for Archegos. ,Kitty Bennett, contributed research."

The result is a documentary that is “cleareyed about its subject and emotional about his legacy,” James Poniewozik wrote in ,. “It celebrates his gifts, catalogs his flaws (which included using racist language in his correspondence) and chronicles his decline with the tragic relentlessness its subject would give to the death of a bull in the ring.”, (1994) ,The director Mike Newell and the screenwriter Richard Curtis worked together on this classic British romantic comedy, about two people (played by Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell) whose love develops in fits and starts.

And the ending. And a lot of material in between, too. The changes are meant to sharpen a trilogy-capping movie that never managed the kind of acclaim that the original “Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” did. Coppola had originally envisioned the film as “a summing-up and an interpretation of the first two movies, rather than a third movie,” he said in ,. He had never wanted to use the “Part III” label in the first place.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/style/lena-dunham-body-positivity-11-honore-spanx.html,arts,"In the 10 or so years since she first became famous, Lena Dunham has been many things. She has been a wunderkind, a writer-director-actor-producer of both feature films and television series, voice of her generation, David Remnick mentee, Golden Globe winner and representative of liberal white privilege. She has been a Vogue cover girl, newsletter maven and subject of social media shaming. Also head of her own book imprint at Random House, endometriosis and hysterectomy survivor, and oversharer.,She has been so many things, in fact (seriously, has it been only 10 years?), that it is kind of extraordinary to realize that one thing she hasn’t been is that increasingly beloved side hustle of almost anyone in the public eye: a fashion designer.,Of course, that may be because another thing she has been is an often unfairly mocked presence on the red carpet, subject of cavalier memes and style police cruelty.,“I am not,” she said recently, “a celebrity who’s ever been asked to represent a product. I am not a person for many reasons who anyone even wants to represent a product.” She does, however, love clothes.,And in the process of wearing a lot of clothes, and getting a lot of clothes “slightly wrong,” and being attacked for the clothes she wore, she discovered a hole in the market. So being Lena Dunham, she decided she was the one to fix it.,This week 11 Honoré x Lena Dunham debuts, a collaboration between Ms. Dunham and the e-tail site that has ,, getting runway designers to make their brands accessible beyond Size 10. It will be 11 Honoré’s first celebrity foray, and it is a tightly edited collection of only five items, because, Ms. Dunham said, “I’ve totally given up on the idea of being any type of impresario or person who had something to say to everyone.” She was speaking over a Zoom call from London, where she has been holed up shooting a film.,“Right now the only thing I’m doing is speaking about my own experience,” she said. “So this clothing line is a direct response to my experience.”,Introducing Lena, version 8.0 (or 15.0?): humble-but-enthusiastic body-neutral advocate and new celebrity designer, at peace with herself and about to emerge into the world once more.,Not just because she has another movie on the way (besides the film she is working on in London), called “Sharp Stick” and written during pandemic summer as “a meditation on the complexity of, uh, female sexual desire and how it intersects with trauma.”,But also because she is not only the designer of the clothing line, along with Danielle Williams Eke of 11 Honoré, but its face and model. Yup, she’s putting herself out there again.,She knows what that may entail.,After years of having a complicated and very public relationship with her body, of yo-yoing in weight because of medical and personal issues, Ms. Dunham, 34, has come to terms with it.,Last March, she got the coronavirus. Everyone knows this, because she later posted “,” on Instagram, where she has 2.8 million followers. Though she has recovered, the disease affected her pituitary gland and left her with partial adrenal insufficiency, she said, so she is taking steroids.,“Not the cool kind that make you muscular,” she said. “Just the kind that make your face fat. I’m trying to roll with that. Trying to be chin positive. I can deal with anything, but a triple chin is a hard place to land.”,Still, she is careful to thank her medical team and talk about how she knows she is privileged to have access to private health care and to be able to do a job.,“It doesn’t mean I haven’t felt a lot of body hatred in lockdown,” she said. She is not a fan of some current terminology, of words like “plus” or “curve” or “body positive.”,“The thing that’s complicated about the body positive movement,” she said, “is it can be for the privileged few who have a body that looks the way people want to feel positive. We want curvy bodies that look like Kim Kardashian has been up-sized slightly. We want big beautiful butts and big beautiful breasts and no cellulite and faces that look like you could smack them on to thin women.”,“I have a big stomach, I always have. That’s where I gain my weight — especially after early menopause, I have a straight-up gut, like an old man — and that’s not where anybody wants to see flesh. It’s not like if I posted a sensual nude of myself on Instagram, people would be marveling at my beautiful derrière.”,As she said this, she did not sound angry or depressed or like she was sticking it to the man. She sounded sort of resigned and amused at herself. She was sitting in a very white room with a fireplace, wearing a cable-knit cardigan and lots of rings on her fingers. Her hair was long, and her bangs were short. In the middle of the conversation, she suddenly began chomping on a sandwich, which made her laugh.,“It seems appropriate for this interview that I eat this large baguette,” she said.,Ms. Dunham had been contemplating getting into fashion long before the pandemic began. She had originally thought she would make a full-fledged collection from Size 0 to 20, because … well, she doesn’t really do half measures. Besides, she’s smart enough, and does enough research, to know that there is a proud history of female designers getting into the business because they know what is missing, whether it’s Coco Chanel or Donna Karan or even the Olsens. But, she said, “there was so much I didn’t know about the infrastructure.”,In 2019, she met Patrick Herning, the owner and founder of 11 Honoré, where she happened to be a frequent shopper. The two bonded over proselytizing for plus-size figures and began hatching a plan. Because Mr. Herning had recently introduced a private label line, he had the supply chain and design staff in place for Ms. Dunham. All she had to bring were the ideas.,“I said, ‘You’re an actor, you’re a storyteller, let’s do this, and then we can do a sequel — Season 2,” he said.,Here’s where she started: “What I really love in fashion is a certain level of playfulness and winky intelligence that people just don’t think bigger women want or understand. No one thinks plus women have a sense of humor, and if they do, it’s, ‘We’re going to put a watermelon on your skirt, you sassy girl!’ None of it has subtlety or true sophistication.”,“There’s so much judgment around bigger bodies, and I think one of the judgments is that bigger women are stupider,” she continued. “They eat too much and don’t know how to stop. Thin women must be discerning and able to use their willpower. Bigger women must be limited in their understanding of the world, and they keep doing things that are bad for them. The amount of people who have written to me on my page: ‘You’re promoting obesity. Don’t you understand you’re killing yourself. Are you stupid? Why are you doing that?’”,For her, fashion is character. She has a new boyfriend, whom she met in London — “It’s been a few months,” she said. “I feel really lucky.” He is a musician, she added, raised in England and Peru, and “the greatest person I’ve ever met”” — and when she borrows his hat and leather jacket, she said, “I want to man-spread!” She considers the designers she loves, including Rachel Comey and Giambattista Valli and Christopher Kane, to be artists, so when she wears their clothes on the red carpet she is celebrating their art.,“That’s why I never understand why anyone would want to go out on the red carpet in a nude column dress,” she said.,For the record, she has never appeared on the red carpet in a nude column dress. She has worn her fair share of little black dresses, but she is more famous for the kind of dresses that are the opposite of LBDs. Like the pink minidress with rubber gloves superimposed on the front along with the word “rubberist,” which she wore in 2019 to the Met Gala in honor of “Camp.” It made her look like a Flower Fairy by way of Marcel Duchamp.,In any case, she went on: “The only way I’ve been able to make the red carpet interesting, or in any way meaningful, is to be myself with no concern for whether the people who are watching are going to anoint it best or worst anything, because then at least I’m saying something about being a woman in this body that only I can say. And maybe there’s some girl at home going to her prom and she feels like she doesn’t have the right body and she sees me in this weird nutty dress and she feels like, ‘If that girl can go to the Emmys dressed like that, then maybe I can show up to my junior prom dressed like this.’”,The clothes Ms. Dunham has helped make for 11 Honoré are not exactly nutty — they definitely are not going to change the world — but they have a little lift. She describes them as clothes for a day walking around SoHo doing all sorts of things. ,They were inspired, she said, by the women she remembers from the 1990s, like Cindy Sherman and Kiki Smith, who would clomp around in men’s shirts and Yohji Yamamoto skirts and unbrushed hair because their very active minds were on other things. That’s a description that may overexcite those who associate her with elitism, but also one that is not entirely inaccurate.,Ms. Dunham’s mother, the artist and photographer Laurie Simmons, named each look after one of the family’s old haunts in SoHo, like the original Dean & DeLuca store on Broadway (now closed), which is the name of a navy pinstriped suit with scalloped hems on the jacket (Dean) and skirt (DeLuca). ,Ms. Dunham’s father, Carroll Dunham, who is a painter, made the print for a geometric floral dress with an asymmetric hem that is called Madderlake, after a florist that also used to be on Broadway. The capsule collection will cost between $98 (for a ribbed mock-turtleneck cotton jersey tank) and $298 (for the jacket), and sizes run from 12 to 26. (She herself has “settled into a Size 14 to 16.”),Ms. Dunham said she spent a lot of time on the fit because one of the things most designers don’t understand is that making clothes for bigger bodies doesn’t mean just adding more fabric or cutting the waist wider. You need to employ darts differently to encompass stomach curves and bottom curves and upper arms that swell in the heat. She really wanted to include a miniskirt because whenever she tried to find one, it would hitch up in the back and, she said, “I can’t wear it because I’m basically showing what my mother would refer to as my pupick.”,What is not in the line is loungewear, despite all the talk about the pandemic and how it will change how we dress. “If a thin girl wears sweatpants, it’s kind of cute — like, ‘I’m having a rough day!’” Ms. Dunham said simply. “But for a chubby girl it’s, ‘You’ve made a lifestyle choice to give up.’” The whole point of this exercise, after all, is not giving up and not just accepting what’s out there.,Rachel Comey, for one, is looking forward to it. “Lena has such a valuable voice,” she wrote in an email. Mr. Herning said that if the first drop works, there will be another, probably more expansive.,Ms. Dunham thinks it would be fun to do winter wear, pajamas and swimwear. But first, the introduction. Even though she has been lying low, at least in Lena Dunham terms, she is still something of a lightning rod for those who find her willingness to expose herself physically and emotionally — to talk about her pain and her issues — touching and those who find it infuriating. When she posted a , in the miniskirt suit as a sort of teaser, most of the comments were along the lines of “Yay!” but some still shamed her about her weight.,“The thing that’s been really interesting is how angry it makes people when you dress like yourself,” Ms. Dunham said. “It’s not, ‘Oh, I don’t like that dress.’ It’s, ‘How dare you?’ And it’s fascinating how much of that comes from other women with bodies that look like mine. It’s not a male gym rat. It’s other women who have been indoctrinated with the same message: ‘Didn’t you get the memo? We’re all doing this. We’re all going to wear the Spanx.’”,She refuses to wear Spanx — most of the time, she said, she barely wears a bra — and none of the clothes she made require it. The one time she did wear a corset to an event, Glenn Close cut it off her in a bathroom.,“She had a little butterfly scissor like a friggin’ angel,” Ms. Dunham said. (It was unclear why Ms. Close would have brought sewing scissors to a gala, but — be prepared!),“She also gave me the best advice. I was crying in my heels, and she said, ‘You get platform boots from a rave store, and you wear those.’ And I did, and I have. So, thank you, Glenn Close.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/books/review/gary-panter-jimbo-adventures-in-paradise-crashpad.html,arts,"“MEET GARY PANTER,” reads a 1988 ad in The Village Voice for a bookstore appearance in support of ,. The buff title character, cross-eyed and crew-cut, resembles an unhinged Billy Idol about to take the rugby pitch. “It’s an avant-garde adult comic book, about the adventures of a punk Everyman, who defines his generation,” the text claims. “Come by for a signed copy and meet a real comic book hero.”,The public wasn’t biting, alas: Only one person showed up.,Ad and anecdote appear in a new edition of Panter’s beautifully chaotic debut book (New York Review Comics, 103 pp., $29.95). They capture the wobbly position of comics as literature, 30-odd years ago: While Jimbo seethes in the advertisement, a photo of B. Dalton’s prim, bow-tied spokes-nerd smirks in the lower right corner, under the motto “You can call me ‘Books,’” as though marking his turf. Jimbo looks ready to give him a drubbing. The ad glosses over the prickly dissonance of Panter’s art, with its jagged textures, cutup logic and shape-shifting antihero.,Panter was still a student at East Texas State University in the early 1970s when Jimbo first popped up unbidden in a comic story he was writing. A few years later, creator and creation met their moment in the Los Angeles punk scene. “Adventures in Paradise” was a decade in the making (1978-88), with parts originally appearing in the magazine Slash, The L.A. Reader and the seminal New York-based comics anthology “Raw.” Nicole Rudick’s excellent afterword situates Panter as a visionary amid a flood of movements, influences, declarations (his own “Rozz-Tox Manifesto,” originally published as want ads, looked for inspiration in smashed-up capitalism) and artistic fellow travelers. (Among the latter was Matt Groening: Jimbo’s close-cropped hairdo would later inspire Bart Simpson’s.),For all the various inputs, Panter’s style is singular, even as it changes from page to page. Un-self-conscious work has a certain purity to it, he said in a 1985 interview, “closer to the way, say, twigs would fall on a sidewalk.” His signature “ratty line” — uneven, fidgety, scathing — is on display everywhere, even in the shapes of his letters. Their brute force grounds the outlandish scenarios in and around the decrepit, at times wondrous, city of Dal Tokyo. (“I’m really into marks,” Panter has said — a way of drawing that’s all about getting “somehow closer to the natural.”) At the Feedomat, Cronenbergian eye-stalks take his order telepathically (“Please think me your desire”); chasing a scuttling robot leads him to La Bufadora, a glorious “skateboard-lifestyle” condo complex. A concert by the band Astrochimp Impact Crater (not far from Fat BBQ U.F.O. Clinic) is like a “Where’s Waldo” set in Bosch’s “Garden of Earthly Delights.”,The book shuns a coherent story line, and Jimbo is alternately a cipher, philosopher, lover and brawler. His appearance fluctuates, at times minimalist and goofy, then turning nightmarish as the primitive “Jimbo Erectus.” Traces of our real world find their way to Dal Tokyo, including a Burger King receipt trapped like a fly in amber. Witty metafictional moments abound: Jimbo blithely disses the comic strip “Nancy” as being devoid of sentiment, only to have Ernie Bushmiller’s eternal creation dress him down.,All of Jimbo’s anxieties come to a head in the bravura final section, as black and white gives way to an ocean-blue palette. It begins like the worst dream in history: Jimbo has to defuse a thermonuclear device, a task he’s hilariously unsuited for. What follows is a steady parade of devastation and insanity. Earlier characters undergo horrible distortions; the desperate text starts crawling in the gutters. We last see Jimbo upright but contorted in agony, a St. Sebastian for the atomic age, flecks of neon orange setting the page ablaze. It’s haunting on the retinal level. The final words are “And the sun went,” — capped with what looks like a comma, not a period. The punctuation takes you back to the beginning, where Jimbo asks, “Have you ever had a dream where you knew you were dreaming, but it was so real that you didn’t trust your judgment?” It’s an exquisite loop, a perfect resolution to this monument of disorder.,Jimbo has starred in two other Panter books, but is absent from his latest, , (Fantagraphics, 36 pp., $39.95), a far-out misadventure involving anthropomorphized dogs, a U.F.O. and 2,000 tabs of acid. If Panter drew inspiration from the energy of punk, his ethos was equally formed by “hippie optimism” and headshop literature from Zap Comix to “Cacti and Succulents Handbook.” “Crashpad” kicks off with an eight-page throat clearing, full of enervating gobbledygook (“No relating vision, however glorious, needs hold one prisoner”) and a tumble of psychedelic images. A little of this goes a long way, but it serves as a sort of set-and-setting for the laid-back and psychotic little story that follows, in which a tripping pack of hippie-dogs (fuzzy faces recalling R. Crumb’s Fritz the Cat) is chased by an uptight sheriff. It builds up to a cosmic joke I didn’t see coming — I haven’t been blindsided by a punchline this good since Knausgaard IV.,Bewilderingly, “Crashpad” comes in two formats, packaged together: a regulation-size, stapled comic book, which slips inside a pocket on the endpapers of a sumptuously produced artist’s edition, with gold foil on its cover, that reproduces the original artwork at its full, unreduced size. The story works better at the more intimate scale, and on one level, a $40 admission fee to view a groovy but short work verges on obscene. If we set aside the cynical notion of a money grab, though, there’s a certain stoner’s logic to putting out both at the same time: instantly elevating the ramshackle fable to a holy text.,A little dazed, I found a better explanation in the first line of Panter’s preface: “In a digital world, it may be important to involve oneself with dirt.” We live in a time of technological wizardry, when so many comics are made at least partly on the tablet: colors easily changed, everything airtight, “handwriting” shunted into fonts. It may indeed be important to see the dirt, the marks, the artist’s true hand and deep nature. Publishing these pages in all their oversize glory reveals the human gradations of his inky sky, occasional marginalia, faint pencil often visible underneath the figures.,I realize this is a romantic view of cartooning, written by a noncartoonist. And I know that many great artists swear by the latest drafting technology. But it’s always good to be reminded that there are other ways. That anyone with a pencil can draw or write. That the twigs on the sidewalk might be telling a story worth looking at."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/travel/sussex-bicycle-portraits.html,arts,"A year ago, as a travel photographer grounded by the pandemic, I started bringing a camera and tripod with me on my morning bicycle rides, shooting them as though they were magazine assignments.,It started out as just something to do — a challenge to try to see the familiar through fresh eyes. Soon it blossomed into a celebration of traveling at home.,I live in a faded seaside town called St. Leonards-on-Sea, in Sussex, on the south coast of England. If you’ve not heard of it, you’re in good company. It’s not on anybody’s list of celebrated English beauty spots. Indeed, most of my riding is across flat coastal marsh or down-at-the-heel seafront promenades.,There’s history here, of course. This is England after all. The lonely marshes I pedal across most days are where William the Conqueror landed his men in 1066. Otherwise, except for being a haunt for smugglers, this stretch of coast dozed away the centuries until the Victorians brought the railways down from London.,Then, for a few gaudy decades, St. Leonards and the other nearby seaside towns became popular bucket-and-spade holiday spots, England’s own Costa del Sol — that is, until budget airfares and the , Costa del Sol, the one in Spain, lured the crowds away and plunged the area into a long and not-so-genteel decline.,As for me, I’m a transplant. I moved here from Australia. After the initial novelty wore off, that of being in England, it assumed a sort of shrugging familiarity — the usual shops, takeaways, a downbeat seafront, rough around the edges but with not-too-inconvenient access to Gatwick and Heathrow and flights to more interesting places.,But a year of exploring St. Leonards and its surrounds, camera in hand, chasing the light, has changed all that. It’s brought home the truth that you don’t need to board a plane and jet off to the far side of the world to experience a sense of travel or the romance of difference. It lies waiting on your doorstep — if you look.,You don’t need to go far. Indeed, I haven’t been able to. With the various lockdowns that have been imposed on us over the past year, it’s been either discouraged or downright illegal to stray far from your residence. All these images were captured within a 10-mile radius of where I live, and most of them much closer than that.,I plan my outings and set out each morning well before dawn in order to be where I want to be in time to catch the first light. In summer that can mean leaving the house as early as 3 a.m. In winter, it’s cold starlight, the crunch of frost under my wheels, occasionally snowflakes swirling in the glow of my headlamp.,I carry everything I need on my bicycle and work entirely alone. I’m both the photographer and the cyclist in the photos. That part’s taken a bit of getting used to. I’ve never been comfortable in front of the camera. As a journalist, I’ve always said I had a great face for radio and the perfect voice for print. But needs must when the devil drives. What with social-distancing requirements and zero budget, I’m all I’ve got.,These images, though, aren’t meant to be about me. They’re meant to represent a cyclist on the landscape, anybody — you, perhaps.,Creating these images has required not only a new way of visualizing, but a whole new photographic skill set. The first question most people ask is how I trigger the shutter when I’m a hundred yards away on my bicycle. Simple. I use what’s called an intervalometer, a programmable timer that allows me to preset whatever delay I need and then have the camera fire off a chosen number of frames. That’s the easy bit. Anyone can take a self-portrait.,Placing yourself artistically in the scene is a far trickier proposition. It requires juggling a maddening number of details, most of which you never think of until you start doing it and look critically at the results. Everything matters, from the drape of light and shadow, to the set of your headlamps, to your body language on the bicycle. You have to be actor, director, location scout, gaffer, key grip, even wardrobe assistant: I always carry a spare jersey or two in different colors to make sure I can work with any backdrop.,What’s more, you have to play all these roles in real time, in rapidly shifting light, in an uncontrolled environment where cars, pedestrians, dog-walkers, horses, cyclists and joggers can — and do! — pop up out of nowhere. It can be hugely frustrating, and yet at the same time intensely satisfying when it all comes together.,It’s addictive, too. Over the past year I’ve become a keen student of local geography — not just the layout of the towns and the architecture and the contours of the landscape, but when and where the light falls as the seasons progress. I know the tide tables like an old salt and follow the phases of the moon. I’ve developed a peasant’s eye for weather. I can tell at a glance, when I step outside my door, those mornings when an evocative mist will be rising miles away on the marsh. I plan my outings with the same jaunty expectancy I used to feel on my way to the airport. And when I push off down the street, the world becomes big again, the way it used to be when I was a child: rich in detail, ripe for discovery.,By the time I return to the house, several hours later, having witnessed the sunrise and put however many miles of Sussex countryside beneath my wheels, I feel as though I’ve , places, , things, , in the grand old sense of the word.,And, ever the travel photographer, I bring back pictures of where I’ve been."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/books/review-hard-crowd-rachel-kushner-essays.html,arts,"“America was a V-8 country, gas-driven and water-cooled,” Harry Crews wrote in “Car,” his 1972 novel. In her first book of essays, “The Hard Crowd,” the novelist Rachel Kushner reminds us that she writes as well as any writer alive about the pleasure of a good motor doing what it was designed to do.,Desire, drama, exhilaration, peeled nerves: Kushner packed these things into the motorcycle racing scenes, out on the salt flats, in , (2013), her breakout novel.,That novel’s force, as the critic Vivian Gornick pointed out in a Paris Review interview, derived in part from witnessing Kushner “doing big, long riffs on these subjects — she’s doing motorcycles, she’s doing Las Vegas, she’s doing the international art world — that men have always taken for themselves.”,The essays in “The Hard Crowd” aren’t all about motorcycles and antique muscle cars, another of Kushner’s pet topics. There are pieces about Italian film and that country’s radical politics; about American prison reform efforts; about a refugee camp for Palestinians inside Jerusalem.,There are intuitive appraisals of writers such as Denis Johnson, Clarice Lispector, Marguerite Duras and Cormac McCarthy. She writes about artists including Alex Brown and Jeff Koons. She roughs up Koons’s image, and complicates him.,There are a pair of long, moving essays about growing up semi-feral in San Francisco in the late 1970s and early ’80s: fake IDs and head shops and Black Sabbath concerts; a shoplifting arrest; bartending and waitressing jobs in the Tenderloin; working in one of the promoter Bill Graham’s concert venues; an all-night PJ Harvey club show that sent Kushner out determined to change her life.,But “The Hard Crowd” swings back around to engines and to motion. The author had found wings; she meant to use them. We watch her move her soul around.,Kushner was born in Oregon, and moved to San Francisco with her family in 1979, when she was 10. Her parents were scientists and integration activists, and she describes them as deeply anti-establishment: “We had no religion or traditions in our house. We had an assortment of characters who took up residence in our lives, and we had books.”,Her father owned, and often worked on, a beautiful motorcycle: a 1955 Vincent Black Shadow. Kushner describes, at age 7, “computing that engine oil under the nails, the ability to kick-start a four-stroke or handle a suicide clutch — these were not just skills but ,.”,Her own motorcycles come to include an orange 500 cc Moto Guzzi, a Kawasaki Ninja and a Cagiva Elefant 650. Her boyfriends tended to be mechanics.,In what might be this book’s best essay, “Girl on a Motorcycle,” she describes riding the Kawasaki, when she was 24, in the Cabo 1000, a dangerous and illegal 1,000-mile race down the Baja Peninsula, often on unpaved roads.,She describes herself as “kinetic and unfettered and alone.” At one point she hits 142 miles per hour. She is going nearly as fast when another biker pulls out in front of her and she is forced off the road and wipes out. There are predatory ambulances; there are bad Samaritans.,“Girl on a Motorcycle” was first published in an anthology titled “She’s a Bad Motorcycle: Writers on Riding,” which appeared in 2002. All the other essays here were written a decade or more after that one.,What’s interesting about “Girl on a Motorcycle” is how fully developed Kushner’s voice already was. It’s a wary voice, cool and wise, with real power and control. There’s some Denis Johnson in it. She describes the love for his work, and for the wrecked characters in it, that she and others felt this way: “It was hero worship of totaled souls, by totaled souls.”,Johnson’s characters drove big old cars. About a $60 Chevrolet, a narrator in his collection “Jesus’ Son” comments: “It was the kind of thing you could bang into a phone pole with and nothing would happen at all.” The cars Kushner comes to own are in vastly better shape: a 1963 Chevy Impala and a 1964 Ford Galaxie.,She describes, with typical aphoristic grace, being in that champagne-colored Impala on a long drive, alone, in the late 1990s. She hits a wall of rain, and she writes:,“I’ve had old cars that leak around the windshield; this one did not. It had working heat and A.C., a functioning radio, intact weather stripping, wipers — these things are luxury and civilization in an antique car. It’s chamber music: You feel on top of the world when you’re dry and moving along in a downpour. In a new car, in which everything is plastic and somewhat ugly and works today but will break eventually, there’s no thrill to function.”,This book’s title comes from “White Room,” the Cream song. “At the party,” the lyric goes, “she was kindness in the hard crowd.” It’s a good line, Kushner observes.,The author spends time in hard crowds: with bikers, truckers, tattoo artists, the members of punk bands. This book has a real gallery of souls. One of Kushner’s crucial realizations comes near the end, when she admits that she is, herself, not so hard as she might have thought or wanted.,“Part of my parents’ influence was this bohemian idea that real meaning lay with the most brightly alive people, those who were free to wreck themselves,” she writes. “I admired a lot of these people I’m describing to you. I put them above myself in a hierarchy that is re-established in the fact that I am the one who lived to tell.”,She continues, in as strong a statement about artistic purpose and sensibility as I’ve read in a while:,“I was the weak link, the mind always at some remove: watching myself and other people, absorbing the events of their lives and mine. To be hard is to let things roll off you, to live in the present, to not dwell or worry. And even though I stayed out late, was committed to the end, some part of me had left early. To become a writer is to have left early no matter what time you got home.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/arts/television/gloria-henry-dead.html,arts,"Gloria Henry, a B-movie actress of the 1940s and ’50s who became best known as the sunny, preternaturally patient mom on the television series “Dennis the Menace,” died on Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 98.,The death was confirmed by her daughter, Erin Ellwood.,Ms. Henry was 36 and a veteran of more than two dozen films in 1959 when she was cast as Alice Mitchell, the gentle, tolerant but constantly horrified mother in “Dennis the Menace,” a sitcom based on Hank Ketcham’s popular comic strip. Dennis (played by Jay North) was an angelic little boy on the surface, but every time he tried to help or just do something nice, it somehow backfired. The show ran for four seasons on CBS.,Gloria Eileen McEniry was born in New Orleans on April 2, 1923, and attended Worcester Art Museum School in Massachusetts. She moved to Los Angeles in her teens and began working in radio, where she began using the last name Henry.,She made her movie debut in the 1947 drama “Sport of Kings,” set in Kentucky horse country. Ms. Henry started at the top in the B-movie genre, starring in the film as a young veterinarian.,Over the next three years she appeared in at least 17 films, more often than not in the starring role. A number of her films were westerns, like “Adventures in Silverado” (1948), “Law of the Barbary Coast” (1949) and “Lightning Guns” (1950). In two films — “The Strawberry Roan” (1948) and “Riders in the Sky” (1949) — she starred opposite Gene Autry, getting third billing, after Autry and his horse.,She also appeared in several sports comedies, including “Triple Threat” (1948), with Richard Crane, and “Kill the Umpire” (1950), with William Bendix. Her best-known film was probably “Rancho Notorious” (1952), which was directed by Fritz Lang and starred Marlene Dietrich.,Once Ms. Henry had made her television debut, in a 1952 episode of “Fireside Theater,” she devoted her career almost exclusively to series TV. Over four decades, on and off, she appeared in shows from “My Little Margie,” “Perry Mason” and “The Life of Riley” to “Dallas,” “Newhart” and “Doogie Howser, M.D.”,Her final television appearance was on a 2012 episode of the sitcom “Parks and Recreation.” ,Ms. Henry’s first marriage, in 1943 to Robert D. Lamb, ended in divorce in 1948. She married Craig Ellwood, the California Modernist architect, in 1949. They divorced in 1977. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and Adam, and a granddaughter.,Ms. Henry, who kept in touch with Mr. North over the years, often commented on her “Dennis the Menace” character’s amazing restraint with her son. “I wasn’t allowed to yell at Jay North,” she told The Los Angeles Times at a 1989 gathering of actresses who had played famous mothers on television. “It was difficult. Being a normal, in-reality mother, I yelled at my children a lot.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/arts/television/review-hemingway-ken-burns.html,arts,"One of the more unsettling moments in “Hemingway,” the latest documentary from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, finds Ernest Hemingway, big-game hunter, chronicler of violence and seeker of danger, doing one thing that terrified him: speaking on television.,It is 1954, and the author, who survived airplane crashes (plural) earlier that year in Africa, had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He agreed to , on the condition that he receive the questions in advance and read his answers from cue cards.,The rare video clip comes after we’ve spent nearly six hours seeing the author create an image of virile swagger and invent a style of clean, lucid prose. But here Hemingway, an always-anxious public speaker still recuperating from a cerebral injury, is halting and stiff. Asked what he is currently writing about — Africa — his answer includes the punctuation on the card: “the animals comma and the changes in Africa since I was there last period.”,It’s hard to watch. But it is one of many angles from which the expansive, thoughtful “Hemingway” shows us the man in full, contrasting the person and the persona, the triumphs and vulnerabilities, to help us see an old story with new eyes.,Burns, whose survey of American history is interspersed with biographies of figures like Jackie Robinson, Mark Twain and Frank Lloyd Wright, might have taken on Hemingway at any time over the past few decades. But there is an accidentally timely aspect to many of his timeless subjects. His “National Parks” in 2009, for instance, came in time to , over the role of government.,Now “Hemingway,” airing over three nights starting Monday on PBS, comes along as American culture is reconsidering many of its lionized men, from figures on statues to Woody Allen. And there are few authors as associated with masculinity — literary, toxic or otherwise — than the writer who loved it when you called him Papa.,It’s tempting to say that Hemingway’s macho bluster doesn’t hold up well in the light of the 21st century, but it didn’t go unnoticed , either. He embraced manliness as a kind of celebrity performance. He fought with his strong-willed mother, who accused him of having “overdrawn” from the bank of her love. He married four times, finding his next wife before leaving the previous one, wanting each to give herself over to supporting him.,He clashed spectacularly with his third wife, the writer Martha Gellhorn (played in voice-over by Meryl Streep), who matched him well, maybe too well to last. A free spirit who resisted marriage at first, saying “I’d rather sin respectably,” Gellhorn would not sideline her ambitions for his. (You might find yourself wishing you were watching her documentary.),Eventually he found a fourth wife, Mary Welsh, who wrote in her diary that he wanted his wives to be “completely obedient and sexually loose.” Hemingway , about Gellhorn, “I made a very great mistake on her — or else she changed very much — I think probably both — but mostly the latter.” The journey that sentence takes is a short story in itself.,But “Hemingway” also complicates the popular image of Hemingway as he-man woman-hater (or, at least, woman-dismisser) in his life and his work. Starting with his early childhood, when his mother enjoyed “twinning” him and his sister, dressing them identically as boys or as girls, the film argues that Hemingway had an “androgynous” mind-set that disposed him to inhabit male and female perspectives in his work. (He also, the film says, experimented with gender-switching role-play with his lovers.),“Hemingway” takes as a test case the story “Up in Michigan,” which ends with a date rape. It was controversial at the time; Gertrude Stein called it , like a painting unsuitable to be hung. But the Irish novelist Edna O’Brien unpacks how Hemingway’s raw, tactile prose centers the woman’s thoughts and sensations. “I would ask his detractors, female or male, just to read that story, and could you in all honor say this was a writer who didn’t understand women’s emotions and hated women?” she asks. “You couldn’t.”,O’Brien is no one-sided Hemingway booster. (She dismisses “The Old Man and the Sea” as “schoolboy writing.”) But she is the M.V.P. of a group of literary commentators here that also includes Mario Vargas Llosa, Mary Karr and Tobias Wolff, all of whom help “Hemingway” do the difficult work of describing an internal creative process from the outside.,The series lays out how Hemingway stripped away excess from his language so that the reader would supply the emotion and thus feel it more deeply. He was inspired by Paul Cézanne, who would repaint the same view to find new ways of seeing it. He admired Bach for his mastery of repetition and used the device to rhythmic, incantatory effect in his prose.,To the usual Burns toolbox of photo pans and archival film, “Hemingway” adds typewriter imagery — keys hammering on pages like irons in a smithy — and animations of manuscript editing.,Its most powerful device, though, is the author’s own words. As sometimes happens with Burns’s celebrity voice casting, I found Jeff Daniels as Hemingway distracting at times for his recognizable voice. But Daniels (like Hemingway, a Midwesterner) gives the passages of fiction and memoir a velvet punch.,You have to convey the power of the writing, after all, to show how literature is still shaped by Hemingway’s ideas of clarity, of mortality, of gender. “He changed all the furniture in the room,” Wolff says. “And we all have to sit in it.”,This is true whether we sit easily or not. “Can you separate the art from the artist?” is a heated and dogmatic argument these days. You must sever the two, in a spirit of see-no-evil, to preserve the precious product; or you must handcuff them together, so that any judgment of a life becomes the judgment on the work, and the work a forensic rap sheet against its creator.,“Hemingway” doesn’t separate art and artist. Hemingway didn’t either. He created a public “avatar” that sometimes overshadowed his work (and threatened to make him a self-caricature) and wrote his life into his art (sometimes with cruelty toward friends and peers). But the documentary also recognizes that life and art don’t always correlate neatly or simply.,The resulting biography is cleareyed about its subject but emotional about his legacy. It celebrates his gifts, catalogs his flaws (which included using racist language in his correspondence) and chronicles his decline with the tragic relentlessness its subject would give to the death of a bull in the ring.,The biggest compliment I can pay “Hemingway” is that it made me pull my “Collected Short Stories” off the shelf after years, to read his piercing, full-feeling work in a new light. This life story is not entirely a pretty picture. But to quote its subject, “If it is all beautiful you can’t believe it. Things aren’t that way.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/womens-basketball-ncaa-tournament.html,sports,"The women’s basketball players of Immaculata often washed their own uniforms. They flew standby to save money, and sold pencils and toothbrushes to finance travel costs to their first national tournament. A collection of pail-pounding nuns made up a raucous cheering section.,But the tiny Catholic school outside Philadelphia dominated women’s college basketball in the early 1970s.,“It was crazy: nuns in full habit banging on metal buckets and yelling for this team,” recalled Cathy Rush, who coached Immaculata to three consecutive national championships beginning in 1972. “We thought we were blessed.”,The advent of Title IX, the federal law that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in nearly every educational setting, made the era an expectant, revolutionary one for women’s athletics. Approaching a half-century later, though, women’s basketball is still struggling for full acceptance in the male-dominated world of college sports and in American society as a whole.,This year’s N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament, which will conclude Sunday in San Antonio, has been a weekslong display of athletic intrigue and talent — and a showcase of the indignities, like , publicized online by the Oregon forward Sedona Prince, that players and coaches say prove that their sport is still seen and treated as second-class.,“It was so blatant, and it pulled back the curtain and it allowed people to say, ‘This is a systemic problem,” said Cori Close, the coach at U.C.L.A.,“People who were intimately involved in college athletics were not shocked, but they were deeply disappointed,” said Heather Lyke, the athletic director at Pittsburgh and a member of one of the N.C.A.A.’s most influential management groups. “They’re thankful that the discrepancies were captured and displayed and that people reacted the way they did, which was appalled or outraged or frustrated. People didn’t dismiss it.”,That is partly because women’s basketball is a powerful force in American athletics, especially compared with what it once was. These days, the sport’s luminaries can be household names, its games collectively draw millions of fans in person and on television, and the inequities that emerged from San Antonio drew swift attention online and in Congress. But a sport that has spent years contemplating ways to break through — and how much it should stand as a brand of its own — is finding it difficult to outrun a history of sexism, infighting and media rights deals that overwhelmingly tilt eyeballs and money toward men’s basketball.,The debacle in San Antonio cast a harsh light toward the N.C.A.A., which was already under , because of , and a crush of public and , to change longstanding rules that would allow players to profit off their fame and benefit in some way from the ballooning financial might of college sports. Now the association is facing doubts over the depth of its commitment to one of its marquee offerings.,“Everybody is looking at treatment issues and promotion issues, when the last 40 to 50 years has been focused on participation issues,” said Donna A. Lopiano, the director of women’s athletics at the University of Texas for nearly two decades and now the president of the Drake Group, a nonprofit organization that seeks changes in college sports. “Now the whole laundry list is open, and that’s significant.”,The N.C.A.A. has repeatedly apologized for the problems in San Antonio and , to lead a review of how it conducts it championship events, with a particular eye toward gender equity and a report expected this summer. But the strategy was privately greeted with shrugs inside the college sports industry.,What, people around women’s basketball asked, could a lawyer conclude that they had not been saying for decades? ,If Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, wants to understand how to resolve the disparities, “he should look in the mirror,” said Muffet McGraw, who coached Notre Dame to two national titles before she retired last year.,“I think they’re oblivious,” McGraw said. “I don’t think they care, either. I think they’re so worried about protecting the men’s tournament, they don’t really bother with anyone else.”,The N.C.A.A. held its inaugural men’s basketball championship in 1939.,It was not until 1971 that the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women opened for business as an alternative to an N.C.A.A. that was already regarded as both dismissive of women’s sports and more embracing of commercialism than academics.,Title IX became law in 1972. By 1973, the A.I.A.W. faced a potent legal challenge to its ban on athletic scholarships, which had been intended to help women’s sports grow without teams facing commercial pressures. Coaches and players from two Florida schools sued and argued that if men deserved scholarships, so did women. The A.I.A.W. relented — a concession that led to a policy change to allow teams to compete even if they chose to offer scholarships. It also set into motion a decline of the organization’s influence over women’s sports and an upending of the athletic order.,Small-school dynasties like Immaculata, where administrators balked at funding scholarships, could no longer compete at the top level. Rush remembers a stark realization: “If I wanted to continue coaching basketball, it had to be someplace else.”,Athletic centers for women were the stuff of miserly legend, with a converted men’s locker room, freshly outfitted with ,, offered to women’s basketball players at Texas A&M.,Schools were simultaneously searching for ways to outmaneuver Title IX, with which colleges were supposed fully compliant by 1978. Christine Grant, the former women’s athletic director at Iowa, recalled the “submerging” strategy: Schools with separate athletic departments would combine them and place the director of men’s athletics in charge.,“It was a very successful strategy that was used in order to keep the status quo,” Grant said.,Still, the N.C.A.A. saw women’s sports as an industry poised to boom and “had two things the A.I.A.W. could not hope to match: money and status,” Pamela Grundy and Susan Shackelford wrote in the book , a history of women’s basketball. The N.C.A.A. had a $20 million budget and promised to devote $3 million to women’s championships, a vow that swamped the A.I.A.W.’s budget of $1 million.,Women’s athletics executives waged a fierce debate over what to do, and whether to cede influence to men, who were suspected by some to be hungry for control, not equity. But when the N.C.A.A. staged its first women’s tournament in 1982, it attracted top teams.,“We were given a whole lot,” said Sonja Hogg, who coached Louisiana Tech to an A.I.A.W. title in 1981 and to an N.C.A.A. championship in 1982. “Not to disparage the A.I.A.W., but they just didn’t have the money. Our athletes were at a disadvantage.”,Few events shaped women’s basketball like the A.I.A.W.’s demise. The embrace of the N.C.A.A. and the parallel pivot toward such a monetized model, current and former executives and coaches said, fed structural inequities that endure to this day. When Title IX was enacted, , were women, but that ,. The inequities are also found inside the N.C.A.A.’s organizational chart and ,, which have left the women’s game understaffed and less funded compared with men’s basketball.,“It’s not comforting to know that for the last 30-something years, there’s still disparity, even at the University of Connecticut, and we’re about as close as you can get to equity as any place in the world,” Geno Auriemma, the school’s coach, told Emmert during , on Wednesday.,Connecticut’s raft of titles and 13th consecutive appearance in the Final Four on Friday, when it lost to Arizona, have drawn much admiration but also have fueled perceptions that women’s basketball was less competitive and entertaining. And some critics have argued the sport is less worthy than the men’s game because it does not generate nearly as much money. Women’s basketball, though, is developing , did generations ago.,In the first 37 years of the men’s tournament, U.C.L.A. and Coach John Wooden won 10 national titles. In the first 37 years of the women’s tournament, Auriemma’s Huskies captured 11. This year’s women’s Final Four included a familiar trio of powers: Connecticut, South Carolina and Stanford. But there was also a newcomer — Arizona — and a mounting case that the women’s game has more competition and depth than the men’s game did at the same stage of its development.,A No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 seed in the women’s tournament in 1998, two decades before the same feat happened in the men’s tournament. And those celebrated U.C.L.A. teams stocked with the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, and Bill Walton are enshrined as some of the greatest ever — but also came at a time when conferences could send just one team to the men’s tournament, cutting down on challenges to U.C.L.A.’s supremacy.,With greater parity emerging, and with women’s sports now an integral part of the American sports landscape, women’s college basketball officials see potential for enormous growth. They have been making a similar case for years.,“I don’t think anyone says, ‘Well, professional basketball, they’re bigger and stronger so I just want to watch professional basketball — not college basketball,’” said Tara VanDerveer of Stanford, who this season became ,. Basketball fans, she said, “appreciate women’s basketball for what it is and appreciate men’s basketball for what it is.”,“I think there’s enough room, whether it’s on television, whether it’s arenas, for both — and for both to be great,” said VanDerveer, whose team will play for the national championship after edging South Carolina. “And we do have a bigger area to grow because we started so far behind.”,In 2013, Val Ackerman, who had led the W.N.B.A., prepared , about the women’s college game and its future. In interviews, she heard wide-ranging recommendations and feedback: “Get scoring up.” The sport is “still an afterthought to most people in positions of authority.” “No one would stay committed to the sport without Title IX.”,But, Ackerman concluded, no women’s college sport was “better positioned in the near term to generate revenues or, potentially, profits.”,Ackerman, now the commissioner of the Big East Conference, detailed an array of proposals, including blending the men’s and women’s tournaments into a single event, much the way tennis does with its Grand Slams, or having the women’s Final Four at a quasi-permanent location. She floated the suggestion of a 24-second shot clock — it remains at 30 seconds — and the idea of capitalizing on basketball’s international popularity by staging a women’s Final Four in China or Qatar.,Some ideas were adopted, like playing 10-minute quarters instead of 20-minute halves. But to read the report now is to see a range of unheeded recommendations, fueling public and private questioning of the N.C.A.A.’s support for a sport that it contends is a priority.,Naz Hillmon, a junior forward at Michigan, noted this past week how, even before she was in college, the official March Madness app did not feature women’s basketball.,“Is it great for us to have this separately or should we always be the exact same as what the men have going on?” she said, adding: “That’s a question that will have to roll through a lot of people’s minds for a little bit to get a definitive answer, because if we want to say that men and women’s basketball is completely equal, then things like that probably should be the same.”,Others eagerly ticked through their lengthening lists of long-term shortcomings. The failure to use the March Madness branding for the women’s tournament. The decision to set up a basketball academy for high school boys but no similar program for girls. The lack of financial incentives, which are offered in the men’s competition, for conferences when teams advance in the women’s tournament. The organizational chart that has the N.C.A.A.’s vice president of women’s basketball reporting to an executive whose primary focus is the men’s tournament.,“We want to be partners with the N.C.A.A., we want to make a difference with the N.C.A.A., we want to be transformative in the lives of women — and men,” said Close, the U.C.L.A. coach and the incoming president of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association.,“We all understand how imperative the men’s basketball tournament is to the structure of the N.C.A.A. — nobody begrudges that, we’re grateful for that,” she added. “There’s a lot of benefit that has happened through the years because of what an incredible event that is. We’re not complaining about that. It’s not that we want anything less for the men. We just want to help our women have more dignity, more investment and more opportunity to master their craft at the same level.”,There have been some successes. Participation in Division I women’s basketball is up slightly from about a decade ago, as is attendance. This year, for the first time since 1995, some women’s tournament games have aired on a national broadcast network, and all 63 matchups have appeared on national television, with some earning higher ratings than professional sporting events.,But the women’s tournament, part of a 14-year multisport deal that the N.C.A.A. signed with ESPN in 2011, is being credited with only $6.7 million or so in media money, much less than many analysts believe it is worth. The N.C.A.A. is earning more than $850 million for the television rights for this year’s men’s tournament. In 2019, when the N.C.A.A. most recently held full championship events, the women’s tournament attracted about 275,000 in-person fans, or roughly 40 percent of what the men’s tournament drew. That year, the N.C.A.A. budgeted $13.5 million less for the women’s tournament than the men’s, a gap that officials attributed to differences in competition formats and the bigger crowds that the men’s game drew.,This year’s troubles in San Antonio, though, brought the sport’s struggles into the spotlight, largely because increasingly empowered student-athletes turned to social media. The N.C.A.A. has blamed logistical challenges related to the pandemic for the breakdown in standards, an explanation that coaches and players said they understood but still left them hurt.,VanDerveer described the entire episode as “beyond a turnover.”,“Your team might go out and make mistakes, but this is not being prepared for the game,” the Stanford coach said. “There’s got to be better communication and decision making.”,Beyond citing the pandemic, N.C.A.A. officials have said little about how so many disparities could have happened at the women’s tournament, which had a dedicated planning staff of six people compared with the 12 who were focused on the men’s competition.,On Thursday, Emmert said the N.C.A.A.’s critics were right to judge the organization by its marquee events.,“They have to be the benchmarks that we judge gender equity by,” he said of the basketball championships. “If we’re failing at that level, we’re failing across the board.”,Lynn Holzman, who played at Kansas State and rose to become the N.C.A.A’s vice president of women’s basketball, told coaches on Wednesday that she expected “pretty substantive changes,” but she did not elaborate.,And so the women’s basketball community waits. They are accustomed to it, they say, frustratingly accustomed. Over the past two weeks or so, some mulled over what the game could have been if the A.I.A.W. had survived.,“Is it time to separate?” Kim Mulkey, Baylor’s coach, said. “I don’t know. Can we sustain it financially? I don’t know. But those are discussions that need to be had at the higher levels by people who are a lot smarter than me.”,VanDerveer said she simply wanted to see more input from players and coaches, offering them “more of a voice so that someone can say, ‘Hey, the weight room doesn’t make any sense.’”,And then there is Rush, the pioneering coach at Immaculata, who said she believed the N.C.A.A. had “worked well” and even proved “transformational” for women’s sports.,But she had a caveat.,“I’m not sure better is the answer.”,Susan C.

East rival.,A slimmed-down Guerrero had a hit in all three games, including an opposite-field shot leading off the second inning against German.,“He makes the lineup a lot better,” Manager Charlie Montoyo said. “That’s what we think could happen. That was a beautiful swing to go opposite field.”,It was Guerrero’s first homer of the season after he hit .262 with nine homers in 60 games last year. The son of the Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero, Guerrero Jr. went on a diet over the winter, and teammates have remarked on his energy this spring.,“I feel a lot better this year,” he said via translator.,Grichuk wrapped a two-run drive around the left-field foul pole two batters after Guerrero, helping Toronto take two of three.,“We were coming in with confidence,” Montoyo said. “It’s even better now.”,T.J. Zeuch pitched four scoreless innings for the Blue Jays, and left-hander Ryan Borucki (1-0) got two outs to escape a jam in the sixth. Julian Merryweather got his second save with a perfect ninth.,German (0-1) allowed three runs over three innings in his first appearance since Sept. 18, 2019. He missed all of last season serving an 81-game ban under Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy after an incident involving his girlfriend, with whom he has at least one child.,German, 28, was applauded by fans in right field when he bolted out of the dugout for warm-ups about 35 minutes before first pitch and got more cheers after completing a 12-pitch first inning.,German repeatedly left the ball up during the second — including on both homers — and was pulled after the third with 68 pitches. He was charged with four hits, a walk and a wild pitch while striking out two.,“It was very exciting to be back on a major league mound and compete,” German said via translator. “I wanted to stay calm and take it all in. Definitely had some issues in the game today, but overall, exciting.”,Right-hander Michael King followed German with six scoreless innings of one-hit ball. King retired his final 15 batters, baffling Toronto with a five-pitch mix. He walked one and struck out three on 68 pitches. He is the first Yankees reliever with at least six innings and no more than one hit since Bob Shirley on Sept. 21, 1986.,“He’s put himself in a good spot to be a real contributor,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said of the 25-year-old.,Bo Bichette became the fastest Blue Jays player to reach 100 career hits, getting there with a first-inning double in his 78th game. Alex Rios had needed 85 games.,Zeuch threw 63 pitches and allowed three hits and a walk with one strikeout. Right-hander Trent Thornton gave up a run in the fifth and was pulled in the sixth after losing a couple mph on his fastball.

It was the largest turnout (by far) for a movie since the pandemic began.,The PG-13 movie was not even an exclusive offering to theaters. “Godzilla vs. Kong,” produced by Legendary Entertainment, was also available on ,, a streaming service that sells monthly subscriptions for $15, less than the cost of one adult ticket at cinemas in major cities.,“People seem ready for emotional release, to experience that human connectivity — laughing together, getting scared together — and complete transportation that only movie theaters can provide,” Mary Parent, Legendary’s vice chairman and head of worldwide production, said in a phone interview.,Overseas, “Godzilla vs. Kong” collected an additional $236.9 million, including a strong $136 million in China, a market that has lately preferred local movies over imported ones. The movie has not yet opened in other major markets, like Japan and Brazil.,Some box office analysts were reluctant to declare a recovery for Hollywood, noting that coronavirus cases have been rising again in the United States and parts of Europe have returned to lockdown. David A. Gross, who runs Franchise Entertainment Research, a film consultancy, said the turnout between Friday and Sunday — while a “clear and positive indication that moviegoing has inherent strengths that aren’t going away” — was nonetheless “half of what it would have been under normal circumstances.”,About 93 percent of theaters in the United States have been cleared to open, but government guidelines limit capacity to 50 percent and, in some big cities, 25 percent. The majority of theaters in Canada remain closed.,But Warner Bros., which distributed “Godzilla vs. Kong,” was too busy popping champagne on Sunday to dwell on buzz-killing caveats. “BIG MOVIES ARE BACK WITH OUR KAIJU-SIZED OPENING!” the studio said in a news release about weekend grosses, using the Japanese term for overgrown movie monsters.,The mash-up of computer-generated titans, directed by Adam Wingard and costing about $155 million to make, benefited from strong reviews. A.O. Scott, assessing it for The New York Times, described it as an escapist romp made with “lavish grandiosity” and “zero pretension.” Ticket buyers gave the movie an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, higher than , in 2019 or , in 2017.,As Hollywood adapts to the streaming age by making new movies more promptly available for home viewing — to the consternation of theater owners — quality matters more than ever, along with size and scope: What is worth a trip to theaters (with face coverings for the foreseeable future) and what is not?,Non-franchise films without spectacular visual effects may have a hard time, box office analysts say, pointing to the disappointing arrival of “,” last month. Godzilla and King Kong, on the other hand, are cinematic comfort food: time-tested, larger-than-life nonsensical fun. A large percentage of weekend ticket sales for “Godzilla vs. Kong” came from large-format theaters that charge a premium for tickets. Imax, for instance, said that about 1,000 of its screenings in North America were sellouts.,“Audiences are demonstrating that pent-up demand to experience blockbuster moviemaking on the grandest scale,” David King, an Imax distribution executive, said in an email.,That was certainly true of Iveth Vacao, who brought her 8-year-old son, Jayden, to an Imax matinee of “Godzilla vs. Kong” at the TCL Chinese Theater in Los Angeles.,“We don’t usually come to theaters, but we wanted to experience something,” Vacao said before the lights went down. “Covid has made us appreciate this kind of thing more. Sure you can get the same movie at home, but not the same experience.”,Jayden did not care to wager a guess about which creature would emerge as victorious. (“Can they both?”) But he was certain about one thing.,“When the next ‘Venom’ comes out, we’re definitely coming back,” he said, referring to “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” scheduled from Sony in the fall. “I want to see it on the biggest screen.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/arizona-aari-mcdonald.html,sports,"Aari McDonald has always had an eye for the ball.,Her mother, Andrea McDonald, who played basketball in high school, first noticed it during family pickup games in Aari’s grandparents’ driveway. When Aari, the youngest of six children, was a few months old, Andrea would set her up in a baby bouncer while she played.,“Wherever that orange ball was, that’s where she was looking,” Andrea said, laughing. “If you didn’t have the ball, you were of no importance to her.”,Connecticut felt the brunt of that focus when , and to the Wildcats’ first Final Four. McDonald’s 26-point performance — her 92nd consecutive game with double-digit scoring, the longest active streak in women’s college basketball — showcased the quickness and the relentless energy that, along with her earned confidence that she can put the ball into the basket pretty much at will, have become impossible to ignore.,“I’m just happy that the world is finally noticing what I can do,” McDonald said in an interview. “I’m a two-way player, and it’s not a one-man show.”,The 5-foot-6 guard grew up in Fresno, Calif., where from a young age she followed in her parents’ and siblings’ footsteps by getting into sports. She is named Aarion, after her father, Aaron McDonald, who played football in college. Her brother Tre’Von Willis played basketball at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Her mother, to Aari’s chagrin, boasts about her own high school basketball highlights with some of the same unflappable confidence as her daughter.,“She used to say her jumper was butter, and that she’d mastered shooting off the backboard,” McDonald said, with a nearly audible eye roll. “I’m like, ‘Mom, come on now.’”,Her mother was her first coach, bringing the then-7-year-old Aari onboard with her Amateur Athletic Union team for children 10 and under. She was the youngest player on the court, but the energetic play that has become her trademark was already obvious, if slightly misdirected.,“I was just literally everywhere,” said McDonald, who fouled a lot. She added, “I would foul out, and my mom would be like, ‘Aarion, what are you doing?’”,Her mother remembers things differently. Aari’s older teammates were reluctant on the court, she said, requiring coaxing to move around and shoot, while Aari was already making improbable shots. “She kept us in those games,” Andrea said. “I had to take a double look, like, ‘Is she really making these baskets?’”,“She was like a little gnat,” her father recalled of those early games. “You just couldn’t get her off of you.”,By sixth grade, McDonald was playing on a boys’ A.A.U. team. She also played volleyball and ran track, but basketball quickly became her top priority. She started getting attention in the local news media when she became her high school’s leading scorer by a large margin as a freshman, and garnered even more when she started getting triple-doubles and even, once, a quadruple-double.,As her abilities grew, she didn’t. McDonald insists that her height never threatened her basketball ambitions and credits her mother for her confidence in spite of being perpetually underestimated.,“Every game, throughout my whole career, my mom has always told me to be a feisty competitor and leave everything out on the floor,” McDonald said. “Me being small, I had to do things that other players didn’t want to do, whether that was diving on the floor for loose balls or taking charges.”,Plus, she believes she has other gifts that have fueled her career. “You can’t teach speed,” McDonald said. “You can’t teach heart.”,Because she wanted to stay on the West Coast, McDonald began her college career at the University of Washington, where Adia Barnes, who is now Arizona’s coach, was an assistant. But McDonald wasn’t content, far from her family and her ailing grandfather — and playing behind the N.C.A.A.’s career leading scorer, Kelsey Plum. When Barnes, who had recruited McDonald, took the Arizona job, the decision to follow her was a fairly easy one.,“This is what we talked about,” McDonald said of the conversations that had led to her transfer. “It’s all coming full circle.”,The transfer, however, meant that McDonald had to sit out a year. A year of playing on the scout team, able to show all of her teammates — but not outsiders who had overlooked her — what she could do. Arizona forward Sam Thomas was a freshman during McDonald’s first season at Arizona, and when she first met McDonald, she was struck by how quiet she was. “She didn’t say anything at all,” Thomas said.,On the court, it was a different story. Barnes would tell her team to defend McDonald in practice. It proved nearly impossible.,“We’re trying to work on our defense, and Aari’s just scoring and scoring,” Thomas said. “We were like, ‘How are we supposed to work on our defense when we can’t stop her?’”,That season, Arizona went 6-24. The next season, McDonald’s first competing for the Wildcats, they won 24 games and the Women’s National Invitation Tournament. She scored 890 points that season, breaking the program’s single-season scoring record set by her coach, Barnes. That energy, which McDonald says is the product of the conditioning that she prioritizes above almost everything else, became infectious.,“She’s always on 10,” Thomas said. “She never, ever, ever gets tired in a game — which is crazy, because I get tired just looking at her.”,In McDonald’s three years playing for Arizona, she has set numerous records and received as many accolades, most recently being named the Pac-12 player of the year and sharing the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Award. That the Wildcats have managed so many tough wins in the tournament is, her teammates say, a testament to McDonald’s impact.,“She’s always been able to score 30 points a game, but I just think now she’s just been growing so much as a leader,” Thomas said. “She’s getting more confident. She’s bringing the team with her.”,In a few weeks, she will most likely have a new team, as her W.N.B.A. draft stock keeps rising with each surprise victory.,Before she goes pro, though, McDonald will face one more huge test in the Wildcats’ title game against top-seeded Stanford. She’ll get ready the same way as usual: by listening to some Dom Kennedy and Meek Mill and eating a lot of bananas. The rest is just what McDonald referred to over and over again as a “strong mind-set,” asserting herself every second of the game.,“My goal is to make it harder for you,” McDonald said. “I want to create havoc.”,If the shots fall, that helps.

Buzbee and Rusty Hardin, the prominent Houston-based defense lawyer representing Watson, have sparred in statements, each trying to discredit the other’s tactics.,Watson, 25, has not commented publicly since March 16, when he said on Twitter that he had “never treated any woman with anything other than the utmost respect” and that he had rejected “a baseless six-figure settlement demand” made by Buzbee before the first suit was filed.,In a statement Friday night, Buzbee said that other criminal complaints would follow in Houston, as well as in other jurisdictions. He added that his legal team had filed a 22nd lawsuit Friday, with the plaintiff echoing the other women’s claims of lewd and coercive behavior by Watson.,Hardin said in a statement that he welcomed the criminal investigation, which he called “long overdue.”,“Now we will learn the identity of at least one accuser,” Hardin said. “We will fully cooperate with the Houston Police Department.”,The 21 suits filed to date accuse Watson of engaging in a pattern of lewd behavior with women hired to provide personal services. In those suits, he is said to have coerced the women to touch him in a sexual manner, exposed himself to women he had hired for massages or moved his body in ways that forced them to touch his penis. The incidents cited in the suits were said to have taken place from March 2020 to March 2021, and in four states: Texas, Arizona, California and Georgia.,In a statement on Friday, the N.F.L. said it was “continuing to monitor all developments in the matter which remains under review of the Personal Conduct Policy.”,The policy allows the commissioner to suspend players or other league employees with pay while the league investigates allegations against them. The league relies on law enforcement and court records in addition to information gathered by its own investigators, including former prosecutors with experience handling cases involving sexual assault.,The N.F.L. is in the midst of its off-season, so Watson and other players are not with their teams or visiting their sites for conditioning or practices. With the exception of certain bonuses, players are paid only during the season."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/world/asia/mount-everest-covid-19.html,sports,"KATHMANDU, Nepal — Mark Pattison played wide receiver for three National Football League teams in the 1980s. Now he wants to fulfill another dream: to climb all seven of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. ,To prepare, Mr. Pattison, 59, packed weatherproof outerwear, polarized goggles and ice crampons. But he is climbing Mount Everest in the midst of a global pandemic. He has supplemented his usual gear with face masks, gloves and sanitizer. He took out extra insurance to pay for a rescue if Covid-19 strikes.,The coronavirus is resurging in South Asia, but Mr. Pattison is undaunted. “I wanted to be there,” he said, “in Nepal, this spring, at any cost.”,Nepal has reopened Mount Everest and its seven other 26,200-foot-plus peaks in the hope of a mountain-climbing rebound. The tiny Himalayan country was forced to close trails last year, dealing its economy a devastating blow. For this year’s climbing season, from March to May, Nepal has granted more than 300 climbers the licenses needed to ascend Mount Everest. Many of those climbers hope to reach the summit, 5.5 miles above sea level. ,The pandemic has made the already deadly climb — traffic on Mount Everest contributed to , — even more hazardous. Local officials have instituted testing, mask and social-distancing requirements, stationed medical personnel at the Mount Everest Base Camp and made plans to swoop in and pick up infected climbers. Climbers are typically greeted in Kathmandu with raucous parties thrown by expedition staffers. But not this year.,“No party. No handshake. No hug. Just ‘Namaste,’” said Lakpa Sherpa, whose agency is taking 19 climbers to Everest this spring, referring to the South Asian greeting.,Mr. Pattison’s expedition group and others will set off this week toward,base camp. The climbing season has drawn some high-profile mountaineers, including a Bahraini prince with a large entourage and a Qatari who wants to be the first woman from her nation to make the climb. ,Nepalese officials have set new pandemic-era requirements for them. At the airport in Kathmandu, the capital, incoming travelers must show negative RT-PCR test results or provide vaccination certificates. Climbers initially had to get additional insurance, adding to the average $50,000 price tag to climb Everest, though the government has loosened that requirement. ,Still, tourism ministry officials and expedition agencies acknowledge that Nepal has no clear plan to test or isolate climbers if one tests positive for the virus.,“We have no other options,” said Rudra Singh Tamang, the head of Nepal’s tourism department. “We need to save the mountaineering economy.”,Expedition companies have been advised to isolate anyone with symptoms and to ensure that paying climbers and staff members are tested before setting out, said Mr. Tamang.,Among those heading to base camp this week is Adriana Brownlee, a British national who dropped out of Bath University to pursue a career climbing the world’s toughest peaks. She said Nepal appeared safe compared to her home country, but also that the risk was worth it for the Nepalis and for climbers.,“They need that support from the climbing community,” she said. “It’s good for the climbers as well, just for the sake of their mental health. They depend on this and I also do.”,Ms. Brownlee, 20, said she was “going absolutely nuts” during lockdown with her parents last year in London. She trained for Everest by running up and down the stairs with a heavy backpack for two hours daily.,“If I couldn’t climb this year,” she said, “I’d probably be depressed at home.”,Nepal, one of the poorest countries in Asia, is taking a calculated risk. In 2019, tourism brought in $2 billion in revenue and employed about a million people. For tens of thousands of Nepalis, the three-month climbing season is the only opportunity for paid work.,The damage from last year’s closure was immense. At least 1.5 million people in the country of 30 million lost jobs or substantial income during the pandemic, according to Nepal’s National Planning Commission. ,Porters who usually cart supplies and gear up the peaks for well-paying foreign climbers were forced to subsist on government handouts of rice and lentils.,Expert expedition guides, many of whom are members of Nepal’s Sherpa tribe, returned to their villages in the remote mountains and grew potatoes to survive.,Some believe the misery was even worse than the numbers suggest. “Tourism contribution can’t be evaluated just from a G.D.P. perspective,” said Shankar Prasad Sharma, a former vice chairman of the commission. ,In January, with the disease seemingly in retreat in South Asia, the government decided to relax restrictions on foreign entry and reopen access to the world’s most famous peak.,But Nepal’s calculated risk now seems more fraught. India, its giant neighbor to the south, is experiencing a worrying rise in infections. A new wave could severely tax Nepal’s already-stretched health care system. ,That new wave has also crimped Nepal’s ability to vaccinate its people. Desperate to meet its own needs, the Indian government has delayed exports of Indian-made doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Nepal was forced , its vaccination program before a donation of 800,000 doses from China, its other giant neighbor, allowed it to resume. Still, it won’t be able to administer a second regimen to the 1.7 million who already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.,Despite potential problems, the climbing season kicked off at the end of March, after the first expedition left Kathmandu. From there, climbers travel by plane to Lukla, the town that serves as the starting point for the 10-day trek to base camp. Once at camp, they spend weeks there acclimating to the altitude and waiting for a window of clear weather to attempt the summit.,Sandro Gromen-Hayes, a filmmaker who documented a British Army expedition of Everest in 2017, said Thamel, the area of Kathmandu popular with broke backpackers, was quieter this year.,“It was swarmed with trekkers and climbers and stoners and everything in between,” he said of his previous visit. “Now Thamel is much quieter.”,Mr. Gromen-Hayes, 31, came to Nepal from Pakistan, where he filmed an expedition on K2, the world’s second highest peak, which is known because of its ferocious winds as “the savage mountain.” Usually bereft of climbers in winter, it saw dozens of top mountaineers who had been cooped up for months in virus lockdowns and then flocked to K2 in December to make an attempt.,Mr. Gromen-Hayes said he had been hooked onto the same rope as ,.,Among the climbing community, “I don’t think a lot of people are concerned about the corona angle,” he said.,Some climbers, like Mr. Pattison, the former N.F.L. player, said they were drawn to Mount Everest this year because they assumed it would be less crowded. But Nepal expects more climbers to apply for licenses beyond the more than 300 who have already, said Mira Acharya, the director of Nepal’s tourism department. ,Mr. Pattison plans to trek in surgical gloves and gown, trading in his face mask for an oxygen mask only when he begins the arduous climb from base camp to the peak.,The record books are motivating Mr. Pattison. He has already climbed the six other peaks on the other continents. Should he climb Mt. Everest, he will be the oldest N.F.L. player to have surmounted the Seven Summits, as the peaks are known, and the first to climb Everest and then clamber up neighboring Lhotse, at 27,940 feet the world’s fourth-highest peak, within 24 hours. ,“I’ve been at this for nine years,” Mr. Pattison said. Despite the pandemic, he added, “I’m ready to go.”,Bhadra Sharma reported from Kathmandu, Nepal, and Emily Schmall from New Delhi."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/sports/baseball/all-star-georgia-voting-law.html,sports,"For major American sports leagues that long have taken pains to stay out of divisive issues around race and social activism, the past few years have seen a remarkable awakening.,Top leagues and their multimillionaire stars have come out forcefully and publicly against police brutality and ,, and just as strongly in support of L.G.B.T.Q. causes and the right of their players to kneel during the national anthem. Players have spoken at protest marches, and leagues have bankrolled new social-justice efforts. In Georgia, a professional women’s basketball team actively campaigned against its owner, a sitting Republican Senator, before last year’s November elections, and in doing so helped , to Democrats.,Still, it was striking when, after days of mounting pressure, the Major League Baseball Commissioner, Rob Manfred, announced on Friday that the league would pull the 2021 All-Star Game out of suburban Atlanta in , that critics have predicted would ,.,Relocating the game — an expensive logistical hassle, and a move that even baseball’s players did not universally support — was a watershed moment for a sport long known more for its traditionalism and its aversion to risk.,Baseball, which until 1947 barred Black players from its teams, was drawn into American sports activism through pioneering figures like , and ,. But more recently, it was also a sport that , to move the 2011 All-Star Game out of Arizona over a contentious immigration law, and stood aside as one of its franchises defended an , and another allowed its fans to continue using ,.,Baseball was the last of the major American sports leagues to acknowledge the killing of George Floyd last year — waiting a full nine days. But it embraced the Black Lives Matter movement when it returned to the field last summer, and by the fall it had volunteered its shuttered stadiums as early voting sites.,The All-Star Game and its week of festivities were set to include celebrations of the legacy of ,, a civil rights icon who died earlier this year. But by Friday, Manfred said, he had concluded that moving the game and baseball’s annual draft out of Georgia were “the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport.”,Over the past five years, sports has embraced an activism that has quietly revealed a power shift from the rich, mostly white men who run them to the not-quite-as-rich, mostly nonwhite athletes who compete in them.,Activism’s arrival in sports is not new, of course. From baseball’s Robinson to boxing’s Muhammad Ali to football’s Colin Kaepernick to soccer’s Megan Rapinoe, athletes have long pressed social-justice causes important to them and their communities. But the breadth and the public nature of the efforts over the past year, as social justice protests swept the nation on the eve of a presidential election, have shown the willingness of leagues, teams and athletes to engage in debates and take positions they had often avoided.,Sometimes the shift was done reluctantly, the result of national politics or changing public opinion. Sometimes teams and leagues were prodded to act by their own players. But Friday showed once again that sports isn’t simply entertainment in a vacuum.,“Throughout the year, there’s been a lot of things going on not only with the pandemic but as a society,” Alex Cora, the Boston Red Sox Manager, told reporters on Friday. “They moved it for the right reasons.”,It was only five years ago that Kaepernick’s decision to quietly kneel during the national anthem to protest systemic racism and police brutality sparked stiff disapproval from some team owners and criticism from a strident part of the white fan base. But eventually, even N.F.L. owners like the Dallas Cowboys’ Jerry Jones, who once , during the national anthem, were , on the sidelines.,And players, aware that their wealth and their stature gave them a valuable megaphone aided by social media, kept pressing. After Jacob Blake, a Black man, was left paralyzed by the police in Kenosha, Wis., the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take part in a playoff game in August in Orlando, Fla. Within hours, dozens of other teams in other leagues ,. Within days, , emerged from a meeting with N.B.A. officials with new commitments that it would join their fight against social injustice.,Some players went beyond causes to overtly political acts like campaigning for specific candidates. In the W.N.B.A., players on the Atlanta Dream became so , by the statements by the team’s co-owner, the Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, about the Black Lives Matter movement that they actively campaigned for her opponent, Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, , onto the court. Loeffler lost the election, sweeping not just her opponent but also another Democrat running in the state to victory.,The two victories gave Democrats, under President Biden, control of the nation’s legislative agenda, and the momentum to push for some of the progressive causes the players held dear.,There were many factors, though, that made M.L.B.’s action on Friday unique. While major league club owners are no different than their counterparts in professional basketball or football in being a largely Republican donor set, the demographics on the field are starkly different. The sport’s fan base is older and less racially diverse than basketball’s and football’s. The majority of major league players are white, and many trend conservative in their personal politics. (Roughly 30 percent of M.L.B. players are Latino, most of them from outside the United States; only 8 percent are Black.),Frustrated by the sense that they are invisible in their sport, some Black players grumbled when M.L.B. took more than a week to address the killing of Mr. Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer last May, and as the ensuing protests over his death — and other Black Americans — quickly spread across the nation. By opening day last July, though, baseball’s leaders had , to organize on-field demonstrations. The league provided Black Lives Matter shirts for players to wear, and teams were allowed to paint a BLM logo on the back of the pitcher’s mound — , for television viewers.,And in September, Major League Baseball — and the players’ union — , to the Players Alliance, a nonprofit made up of more than 100 current and former Black players. The group was among those Manfred spoke with this week before announcing his decision to move the All-Star Game.,“We will not be silenced,” the Players Alliance , on Friday, decrying the Georgia law and how it paved the way for similar legislation elsewhere. “We won’t back down in the fight for racial equality. We will never stop breaking barriers to the ballot box.”,For baseball, the groundswell against its hosting the All-Star Game in July at the Atlanta Braves’ stadium, Truist Park, grew as Manfred worked the phones this week. As political activists and important corporate partners of the Braves like Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola spoke out against the voting law, Manfred held conversations with team owners and the players’ union and current and former players, but he didn’t require a formal vote of approval for his decision. In fact, the union hadn’t yet finished canvassing players when Manfred made his announcement. Some players, such as the Braves star Freddie Freeman, , for the game to stay in Atlanta, so it could serve as a platform for a discussion about voting rights.,In a rare public rebuke of M.L.B. by a team, the Braves said they were “deeply disappointed” by Manfred’s announcement that he would move the game, and called businesses, employees and fans in Georgia “victims” of his decision.,Other teams, though, stood just as strongly behind Manfred.,The Miami Marlins part owner Derek Jeter, a Hall of Fame former player and the only nonwhite chief executive in baseball, released , that supported Manfred’s decision and noted that his team in November had engaged in an activity — providing meals to voters at a polling place — that is now illegal in Georgia. And the Baltimore Orioles chief executive, John Angelos, released a statement with Mayor Brandon Scott of Baltimore, who had lobbied earlier in the day to host the All-Star Game. “As the birthplace of civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall, we stand united with Commissioner Manfred in denouncing this malicious legislative effort to suppress voters in Georgia and other state legislatures,” they said.,Although no active player had publicly called for a boycott of the All-Star Game, Manfred understood what could happen if Atlanta remained the host city, a baseball official said. The tributes to Aaron would have celebrated perhaps the greatest Black player in history. But if the event remained in Atlanta, players and coaches might be faced with questions about whether they would take part or stay away to protest the voting law.,Dave Roberts, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ manager, who is Black and Asian-American, had said last week that he would consider declining the honor of managing the National League team. But on Friday, he sounded relieved.,“For the commissioner, to kind of do his due diligence in baseball, outside of baseball, players, front office, and ultimately make a decision to remove the All-Star Game and the draft out of the state of Georgia, I support,” he told reporters.,A star in another sport was equally thrilled. “Proud to call myself a part of the @mlb family today,” LeBron James of the N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Lakers wrote on Twitter, quietly reminding fans that he had , this week.,The voting organization that James launched last year, ,, went further: It noted that it had called on Georgia lawmakers to drop the voting bill during the recent N.B.A. All-Star Weekend in Atlanta, and it cautioned other states contemplating similar measures.,“All the states still considering voter suppression bills should take note,” the organization , citing the M.L.B. All-Star relocation. “Actions have consequences.”,Alan Blinder contributed reporting."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/sports/soccer/fifa-afc-mariyam-mohamed.html,sports,"The ruling, when it eventually came, could not have been more clear.,One of soccer’s six regional bodies had engaged in discriminatory behavior against a female official by hindering her chances of getting a seat on its board and a leadership position with the sport’s global governing body, FIFA.,The official, Mariyam Mohamed, also convinced judges at sports’ top court that an influential Kuwaiti sheikh had , held by the Asian Football Confederation in 2019 to achieve his desired outcome.,The full ruling, which has not been published, was obtained by The New York Times. In it, a panel at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland concluded that the inaction by Asian soccer officials over several months amounted to a “,” for Mohamed. Yet two months since the decision was announced, the impact of what on paper appears to be a powerful denunciation of ethics breaches and a disregard for women’s rights has had all the effect of a snowball hitting a tank.,Nothing has happened.,The tainted elections will not be rerun. The men who offered Mohamed inducements to drop out have not been punished. And soccer’s leaders have taken no action.,FIFA said in an email it had no comment on the matter, even though in the aftermath of the verdict it insisted it would follow up on the court’s findings with soccer officials in Asia. Asian soccer’s governing body also declined to comment, saying its leaders had nothing to add to a January statement in which they had pledged the organization would review the findings.,For Mohamed, the silence has been maddening.,“It’s just a game for them, justice denial, the same process that I was in,” she said in a phone interview. “They’re waiting for time to pass by, and hoping I get fed up. Now the verdict has come and it’s just very sad. I don’t know where else to go now.”,Mohamed, who first filed her complaints to the Asian federation’s disciplinary department in May 2019, says the months since her victory have felt like history repeating itself. She initially celebrated the triumph, but has come to realize it may amount to only a Pyrrhic victory.,She has not been contacted by officials from the A.F.C., she said. Nor has she heard from ethics investigators from FIFA, even though the organization’s rules state that gender discrimination is “strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.”,The case and its aftermath have highlighted how power works in global sports. It shows how a tainted Gulf royal , has been able to exert significant control over one of soccer’s largest governing bodies even though he has no official role in its affairs. And it shows how a strategy of delay can be its own kind of injustice.,Mohamed’s case had roots in FIFA’s response to its own problems with discrimination: To address a lack of women on its governing board, the organization since 2013 set aside specific seats for women, starting with one voting member in 2013 and now a minimum of one from each of FIFA’s six regional confederations.,Mohamed, a former soccer player and coach from the Maldives, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, had hoped to win the A.F.C.’s spot in a vote in Kuala Lumpur in April 2019. It did not take her long to realize that the power brokers of Asian soccer had already decided the election’s outcome.,She filed her first complaints about the election to the Asian confederation’s disciplinary department a month later. Emails show the organization responded to her inquiries by insisting it had begun an investigation, though it appears little was done. The A.F.C., citing confidentiality, refused to supply any evidence of its investigation to the court.,Then, at a hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport last July, the A.F.C. hardly put up a defense. Its lawyers offered no witnesses to challenge Mohamed’s testimony that a top confederation official and the head of the soccer federation of Qatar had been present in a luxury hotel suite when the Kuwaiti sheikh, Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah, told Mohamed he had decided that his preferred candidate, Mahfuza Akhter Kiron of Bangladesh, would be elected as the A.F.C.’s female representative to the FIFA Council.,Mohamed was told she should drop her candidacy, and do so within 24 hours. She later claimed, in testimony that went unchallenged by the A.F.C., that Sheikh Ahmad attempted to mollify her by saying he had so much sway in international soccer circles that he could obtain for her “any other position of her choosing at the A.F.C. or FIFA” in exchange for her withdrawal.,By this point, Sheikh Ahmad had no official role in soccer, having resigned his own position on the FIFA Council in 2017 after allegations emerged in a United States federal court that he had bribed Asian officials. But Mohamed’s decision to take her case to court provided a rare public glimpse into his continuing stature as a power broker in global sports through his role as the president of the Olympic Council of Asia, an organization created by his father in 1982.,At a 2013 International Olympic Committee meeting, for example, Sheikh Ahmad’s support helped Thomas Bach secure the I.O.C. presidency and also deliver the 2020 Summer Olympics to Tokyo. Since he was indicted in a forgery case unrelated to sports in 2018, he has “,” from two prominent Olympic roles. But his opinion still carries weight.,Ahead of the A.F.C.’s 2019 elections, his legal troubles did not seem to be an issue. A list of his favored candidates was distributed to A.F.C. voters on the eve of the elections and, aware of the talks with Mohamed and of Sheikh Ahmad’s preference for a different candidate, the leaders of several federations pressured Mohamed to drop out, she said.,She declined to withdraw, but lost the vote anyway, 31-15. Every candidate on Sheikh Ahmad’s list, however, was elected either to seats on the A.F.C.’s executive board or, as in Kiron’s case, as a confederation representative to FIFA.,After reviewing the evidence presented by Mohamed and her lawyers, the CAS panel made clear in the summary of its decision that ,. The panel confirmed that the 2019 elections had breached FIFA and A.F.C. rules on gender discrimination. It concluded that Sheikh Ahmad had tried to influence the outcome, and that the A.F.C. had denied Mohamed justice by not making a ruling on her complaint. It did, however, also say that by not bowing out of the elections, Mohamed ensured the sheikh’s efforts to influence the election in her case were not effective.,But the court said it was powerless to order that the flawed elections be annulled, or to punish any of the individuals accused of interfering with them. Any decision on further action was for FIFA, and the A.F.C., to decide, the court said.,Because of the rules governing the court, the panel’s full findings have been cloaked in secrecy since the verdict was announced on Jan. 25.,“If nothing happens it is a disgrace for FIFA, the A.F.C., and undermines the authority of CAS indirectly,” said Miguel Maduro, the former FIFA governance head who gave evidence in Mohamed’s case. “This award and what follows tells us at once that CAS has exposed corruption at the highest level of elections in football and at the same time tells us they cannot do anything about it.,“What does this tell us about entire structure of justice in sports? It’s an indictment.”,Maduro added that at the very least, FIFA should have initiated an ethics inquiry after the ruling. To date, it has not.,Such a move, though, would be extremely sensitive for soccer’s global leadership. The FIFA official responsible for overseeing the 2019 election, Eduardo Ache, told the CAS panel that soccer’s ,to improve female representation were mere recommendations. The panel said Ache’s evidence suggested he was “prepared to accept any discrimination provided at least one woman was elected to FIFA.”,But pressing for discipline in the case also could be uncomfortable for FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, who relies on the support of national and regional soccer leaders to push his agenda. He recently spent two weeks touring Africa, for example, to ensure that his favored candidate, a South African billionaire with no high-level experience in soccer administration, was elected president of the continent’s regional confederation. And he is unlikely to press for discipline against the leader of Qatar’s soccer federation — reportedly present when Mohamed was offered inducements to step aside — or any other Asian leader a year before Qatar hosts the 2022 World Cup.,The longer the full ruling in Mohamed’s case goes unpublished, though, the more it will give the appearance soccer’s leaders are trying to brush a problematic situation under the carpet, said Johan Lindholm, a professor of law at Umea University in Sweden who has published a book on CAS.,“Whether it’s because of bad P.R. or there are other things going on, then you would probably want to keep it as secret as possible,” Lindholm said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaa-womens-team-out.html,sports,"Word had trickled down in late December to J.D. Gustin, the women’s basketball coach at Dixie State University, a southern Utah college making the leap to N.C.A.A. Division I athletics, that some of his players had misgivings about continuing to play during the pandemic.,At that point, most of the players and coaches had previously contracted the coronavirus, and the team had canceled three of its first six scheduled games because of infections. But their Western Athletic Conference season was about to begin, and the coach needed to know where his team stood.,So Gustin handed his players a brief letter he had typed himself. It reassured them that their scholarships were secure but also asked a yes-or-no question they could answer anonymously: Did they want to opt out of the season? He asked everyone to think about it overnight and then fold the papers in half and return them.,The verdict arrived the next day: Eight wanted to play; six wanted to opt out.,“It shocked me,” Gustin said of the divide. “I was reeling.”,Immediately, he began meeting with players individually. One was struggling with online classes. Two had parents who had lost jobs. Some players had injuries that might have been connected to getting sick. Others had lost family members to the virus.,Still, Gustin thought,there were enough who wanted to play, and he felt obligated to honor their wishes, too. For some of them, basketball could soothe feelings of isolation.,So on Jan. 3, he sent a letter to the team on university letterhead, breaking down how the team had voted and laying out why he thought the season could go forward. He asked the players to let him know by noon the next day if they were in or out. He closed the three-page letter by writing, “Love you all no matter what.”,The next day after practice, one of the players who had written that she wanted to play asked to speak with him. She said that she actually feared continuing to play, Gustin said, but was uncomfortable expressing that because her parents wanted her to keep going and because her roommate, also a member of the team, favored playing.,That night, Gustin went to athletic department administrators. “I said, ‘We can’t do this,’” he said.,A news release was crafted, and the announcement came the next day, Jan. 5: The Dixie State Trailblazers were canceling their season.,As the women’s national tournament headed toward its championship game on Sunday in San Antonio, and the men progressed toward their final in Indianapolis on Monday night, teams have been lauded for their perseverance in playing during the pandemic. Hundreds of games were postponed or canceled during the regular season; some teams paused their seasons for weeks; and those who advanced to the N.C.A.A. tournaments have been isolated in hotels to avoid contracting the virus.,But not everyone made it to the finish line. Or even the starting blocks. The eight Ivy League colleges were among those that never started, their presidents deeming sports too great a health risk. Others reached the same decision after the season had begun. Including the Ivies, 27 Division I women’s teams and 13 on the men’s side canceled their seasons early because of concerns about the virus, according to the N.C.A.A.,Among the women’s teams were prominent names — Duke, Virginia and Vanderbilt. Varied circumstances contributed to the decisions to cancel: Southern Methodist’s players had previously accused their coach, whose contract was not renewed last month, of abusive behavior; a Vanderbilt player developed a heart condition linked to the virus; Cal State Northridge did not have enough players. ,There appeared to be a common factor: The decision was not simple.,“For myself, it’s been an internal battle,” Vermont Coach Alisa Kresge said in an interview after her team ended its season in late January. Two of her grandparents died in nursing homes from the virus, both of them saying their last goodbyes on a video call. And her players went into quarantine three times, having food delivered and texting roommates with advance notice about trips to the bathroom. But for many of Kresge’s players, who had won three consecutive games when their season ended, basketball was an emotional and mental outlet.,“I sit on the fence every day,” she said. “Are we doing the right thing? Should we be making decisions for others? There are so many layers to this.”,Those conflicts were not exclusive to the teams that gave up their seasons. Mike Krzyzewski, Geno Auriemma, Rick Pitino and Tara VanDerveer, all Hall of Fame coaches, expressed misgivings during the regular season about playing amid the pandemic. And an N.C.A.A. poll released in February, which surveyed more than 25,000 athletes, found that mental health concerns last fall were nearly twice as prevalent as in prepandemic surveys.,At Dixie State, worries had percolated for months.,Gustin, in his fifth year as coach, understood from experience that the strands that bind a team are manufactured only partly at practice and in games. In a normal summer, his players would work as counselors at a Dixie State youth camp during the day and play pickup games at night. There would be a team barbecue in August, a retreat to cabins in the hills, tailgating at football games and group outings to student events. Later, there would be Halloween and Christmas parties.,All of that was wiped out in the past year.,When players returned to the campus in St. George for the fall semester, some barriers between teammates, which might have been knocked down in a typical year, remained standing.,Emily Isaacson was recovering from surgery to repair torn knee ligaments that cut short her freshman season. Isaacson, eager to please and a sharp student from speck-on-the-map Perry, Utah, had poured herself into rehab over the summer. Even if she wasn’t ready to play 40 minutes a game, she was ready to start the season opener. “I was so grateful to be playing,” she said.,MaKayla Johnson, a senior from Fort Worth with a worldly view and a big personality, arrived in far from game shape. Players intuitively know who is laser focused at practice, staying after to take extra shots or getting to the weight room early, but few at Dixie State understood what the pandemic had been like for Johnson.,Her church superintendent and a relative died from the virus in the early stages of the pandemic. Johnson, who has asthma, contracted the virus in June and struggled with her conditioning. Her father developed Covid-19 in August and suffered a series of strokes, prompting Johnson to return home from campus briefly. Her mother contracted the virus, too. Johnson said she had lost someone almost monthly in the past year.,She has experienced loss before: An older sister died of lupus when Johnson was in the fourth grade. But this was different.,“It’s been kind of tough for me, but basketball has always been a grieving tool,” said Johnson, one of two Dixie State players who had deaths in their extended families. “I’d use it as an escape. Whenever I was dealing with something, it wasn’t hard for me to separate things from inside the lines.”,Johnson said that she had voted to continue the season but that she fully accepted her teammates’ decision to end it.,The ability to compartmentalize — to shut out crowd noise, the pressure of a big moment or off-the-court drama — is often viewed as a valuable tool for an athlete. Few of the Dixie State players do this more adeptly than Isaacson. She had to spend her birthday under quarantine, and then she contracted the virus, with mild symptoms, shortly after Thanksgiving. But she had basketball.,“I wanted to play so badly,” Isaacson said. “Because of my last year, you don’t know what it’s like until you don’t have it. I love basketball. It’s a part of me.”,When Duke canceled its season in December, she thought, “Oh, there’s no way that would ever happen to my team.”,And then it did.,Isaacson, who cried when Gustin told the team its season was over, was angry and frustrated to have lost another season. She was also sad that she didn’t know the depths of the hurt some of her teammates were experiencing.,“That broke my heart,” she said. “I didn’t know teammates had family who were sick and they kept it to themselves. I didn’t want anyone carrying that, thinking, ‘Can I just get through this practice?’ It opened my eyes. I have to realize it’s bigger than basketball.”,Three months have passed since the decision to stop playing.,Everyone in the program has had time to think — particularly Gustin. His teams had improved each season, from five wins to 12 to 15 and then to 18 in 2019-20, the team’s last season in Division II. He went to the WAC tournament in Las Vegas to watch games and meet conference officials. He has spent more time watching film than he can ever remember.,He also spent time reflecting on the decision to stop.,Another coach at the college told Gustin that he would have found kids off the street to keep playing. Though senior administrators were ultimately supportive, there was some initial conflict among them. All of this was taking place in a community where the pandemic was seen, in some quarters, as overblown. “New York City is different from St. George,” Gustin said. “It’s a very conservative, white community.”,There has also been another consideration: his job security.,As a result, he decided to overhaul his roster.,The N.C.A.A. has allowed every athlete in a fall or winter sport to take an extra year of eligibility because of the uncertainties of a pandemic season, but only eight Dixie State players are returning. Some are not having their scholarships renewed for tactical reasons — Gustin wants to play a more up-tempo style. Others were denied because he felt that the players had used the pandemic as an excuse not to work on their skills or physical condition. (He said that only three players, one of whom was Isaacson, had done voluntary individual workouts with coaches in January and February.) Others chose to move on; one player wants to become a firefighter.,The conversations, he said, were often tearful.,“It’s like you’re piling on, but it’s your choice to pile on if you’re me,” Gustin said. “I’m not trying to be a bad guy, but this is D-I basketball. I understand this is debatable, but we needed a fresh start. The past is the past. I respect Covid, but Covid days are over.”,Johnson is among those not returning, a decision she said was hers. She is on track to graduate with a degree in recreation and sports management — she is finishing up an internship at a gym near campus — and wants to transfer to a college near her home in Texas for her final season. ,“I’m embarking on a new journey,” she said.,When next season’s Dixie State team held its first practice on March 15, that, too, felt like a new beginning. The Trailblazers will go to Costa Rica in August to play three exhibition games and spend a few days at the beach. It is partially a reward, Gustin told the players, for sticking through the last 12 months.,It is also insurance. The players will get to know one another, and the coaches will get to know them, too. The college’s sports psychologist met several months ago with the team, without the coaches present, and he reported back to Gustin: There was no trust in this room.,“That’s something,” Gustin said, “that a coach doesn’t want to hear.”"

A bat used by Ruth to hit the first home run at the old Yankee Stadium in 1923, sold by the same company in conjunction with Sotheby’s, fetched nearly $1.3 million in 2004.,As part of the same online sale in which Gehrig’s bat was auctioned, an , that was installed just before opening day in 1923 sold for $303,277, the auction house said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/sports/baseball/shohei-ohtani-angels.html,sports,"Shohei Ohtani had tantalized as a pitcher and as a hitter in the past, but he had never done both in the same game until Sunday night. Finally putting his full arsenal on display in prime time, Ohtani, the Los Angeles Angels’ Japanese star, dazzled with 100 mile-per-hour fastballs and also hit the hardest home run of any batter so far this season.,His thrilling day ended with a scary scene, though: Ohtani on the ground in pain, after having had his feet taken out from under him ,. After the Angels rallied in the bottom of the ninth to beat the White Sox, ,, Ohtani was left with a sore ankle and one of the wildest no-decisions you will come across.,“What he did tonight was pretty special, and you’re going to see a lot more of that,” Manager Joe Maddon told reporters after the game. “It was fun to watch. I think everybody was entertained. That’s what he signed up to do, and you’re going to see more of it.”,The awkward ending for Ohtani — the Angels said he was fine — slightly marred a game that had turned into a celebration of a player who was likened to Babe Ruth when he first came to the United States from Japan.,Sunday’s setup was without precedent in recent decades. Ohtani started on the mound and batted second — a first for a pitcher since 1903. And he was clearly up for the honor, crushing a 451-foot home run on the first pitch he saw from Chicago’s Dylan Cease.,The exit velocity on Ohtani’s blast was 115.2 m.p.h., which is not only the hardest-hit home run of the season, but is the hardest recorded by an Angels player since Statcast data began being collected in 2015.,For good measure, Ohtani also threw nine pitches that topped 100 m.p.h. in four-plus innings of work, topping out at 101.1 on a fastball to Adam Eaton in the fourth inning that resulted in a groundout. It was the fastest pitch thrown by a starting pitcher anywhere in baseball this season.,Ohtani’s final line(s) for the day:,“I’m glad I got this game under my belt,” Ohtani told reporters through his interpreter. “It will lead to more confidence.”,He added: “I’m not out to prove the doubters wrong or anything.”,The decision to have Ohtani bat for himself in an A.L. game was unusual — only two other starting pitchers have batted for themselves in an American League game since the designated hitter was introduced in 1973 — but the choice to have him hit so high in the batting order was far more rare, regardless of league.,Ohtani was the first starting pitcher to bat first or second in a game since Jack Dunleavy did it for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1903. Dunleavy, a two-way player who regularly served as a right fielder as well as a starting pitcher, started at pitcher and batted second in the second game of a doubleheader on ,. His double-duty game didn’t go well: He went 0 for 4 and allowed seven runs in a 7-3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds.,While Ohtani’s abilities as a pitcher and hitter were well known long before he came to the United States, he had always employed a designated hitter during his starts on the mound, while also taking an extra day off as a batter in advance of days he was scheduled to pitch. But after elbow issues resulted in his being limited to only two starts on the mound over the last two seasons, he reported to camp fully healthy this spring and rumors began to buzz that he would bat for himself on days he started.,“Don’t you love it?” Maddon had previously told reporters when asked about Ohtani’s decision to bat on the days he pitches. “This is all him. This was him deciding that he could do this.”,The downside to two-way play, of course, is ,. But it was in his duties as a pitcher that Ohtani dealt with a serious scare.,The bases were loaded in the fifth inning when Ohtani let in a run with a wild pitch, narrowing the Angels’ lead to 3-1. He then appeared to escape further trouble when, with two outs and runners on second and third, he struck out Yoan Moncada with a splitter. But catcher Max Stassi was unable to catch the ball, resulting in Moncada’s taking off for first base.,Stassi’s throw to first was wild enough that the runner on third scored while Jose Abreu, Chicago’s supersize first baseman, rounded third and headed home. Ohtani dutifully covered the plate, but had to reach well above his head for a late throw. As Ohtani came down to the ground, Abreu’s slide carried him directly into the pitcher’s left leg, sending Ohtani to the ground grimacing in pain. He was immediately removed from the game.,While there was nothing unusual about Abreu’s slide, the play certainly looked scary for Ohtani. But shortly after Ohtani was removed from the game, ESPN reported that the team had said he was fine. The Angels reported that he had only general soreness, and that he would be re-evaluated on Monday.,“I can’t really pinpoint exactly where he hit me, but he took my legs out, basically, somewhere around my calf,” Ohtani said. “I landed on it, but the impact wasn’t as bad as it looked initially.,“As for tomorrow, will have to talk to the training staff.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-tournament-pandemic-missing.html,sports,"INDIANAPOLIS — When Jalen Suggs’s prayer masquerading as a 40-foot heave kissed off the glass and went through the net as the buzzer sounded late Saturday night, all he could think to do was mimic his basketball heroes, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade.,So Suggs sprinted across the court, leapt atop one of the tables near the sideline and thrust his arms in the air triumphantly. The shot, the dagger at the end of overtime that finally vanquished U.C.L.A., instantly jogged the memory banks for context: ,, , (who was deprived of a forgiving bounce), , and , (look that one up, kids) — all cherry-on-top shots of epic N.C.A.A. men’s tournament games.,Still, this is the season played during a pandemic, with its accompanying disruptions and restrictions, and it was all but impossible not to see it through that prism.,That’s especially so if you were inside Lucas Oil Stadium, the cavernous football stadium that in normal times would be packed with more than 75,000 fans.,Instead, one of the concessions to hold the tournament, which is worth close to $850 million in television rights for the N.C.A.A. and is being played in its entirety in Indiana, was that there would be attendance restrictions. And so the stadium was divided in half with a giant curtain — Miley Cyrus played on the other side between the semifinal games — and when the final buzzer sounded, there were 8,131 fans — about as many as there were cardboard cutouts — who bore witness.,“Obviously the stadium would have erupted,” Gonzaga guard Joel Ayayi said on Sunday, acknowledging that by now he and his teammates are used to the muted atmosphere. “It would have been really loud. I think it would have brought that moment even more on the crazier side. The reality is it wasn’t.”,There was a visceral thrill in the moment, for sure, but the distance the fans were kept from the court served as a sort of aural moat, muffling rather than amplifying the experience. Other usual accouterments — bands and cheerleaders — were also absent.,It was a reminder that no matter how much manufactured noise is piped into a television broadcast, proximity matters. The crowd are the dabs from a painter’s palette that brings sports moments to life.,If , that bounced one, two, three, four times on the rim — while a packed arena (and all of Canada) held its breath, frozen in place — had dropped in at the N.B.A. bubble, would it have carried the same resonance?,How about Tiger Woods , in the dimming light at the Masters? Or the Yankees putting men on base for a late October rally in the Bronx? The day after the Chicago Cubs won their first World Series in 108 years with a Game 7 victory in Cleveland, a taxi driver told me it was hard to follow along on the radio: the crowd was so evenly split, there was a roar at every big moment — though nothing quite like when Rajai Davis belted a dramatic home run.,Diminished for this tournament, though, is not just the tableau, but the voices that animate the moments.,The last time the Final Four was held in Indianapolis, the N.C.A.A. issued more than 2,000 news media credentials. This year, there are a fraction of that with room for only about 20 reporters who are stationed behind the basket where Suggs started his sprint upcourt. There are others along a radio row at the concourse level, and more in an auxiliary press box in the upper reaches of the stadium.,Locker rooms are closed, of course, and videoconference interview sessions after games are restricted to the coach and one player from each team. A poignant scene from the last Final Four — Auburn’s Samir Doughty sitting at his locker, answering each and every question with a veteran’s composure about the last-second foul he committed that helped send Virginia through to the title game — would not be seen this year.,Late Saturday night, the elation in Suggs and the exhaustion in Johnny Juzang, who had carried U.C.L.A. to the cusp of a monumental upset, seeped through the screen. But missing were perspectives that would normally be gleaned from each locker room. The view of Corey Kispert, who inbounded the ball and was trailing the play, or of Drew Timme as he stood under the basket tracking the flight of the ball. Or the reaction from U.C.L.A.’s David Singleton as he planted himself — arms ramrod straight in the air — in Suggs’s path.,Those, however, are just the trade-offs that have come to define this tournament.,In normal times, the 16 teams that survive the tournament’s first weekend return to campus and bask in the attention from their fans for a few days before flying on to the next site. For the fortunate teams that reach the Final Four, the drill is repeated.,This year, there are no such distractions, pleasant or not. Players are alone with one another — seeing even their parents only with rows of empty arena seats or hotel lobby windows between them.,When Suggs climbed down from the tabletop and Gonzaga finished celebrating, the Zags walked back up the tunnel to their locker room. The 34 members of their traveling party returned to their hotel, convened for a late-night meal and tried their best to turn their attention away from one heavyweight fight and toward the next — Monday night’s title game against ,.,A game between the best two teams in college basketball, neither of whom has won a title, promises to provide lasting memories. This year, though, they will just have to be at a distance."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/sports/ncaabasketball/what-time-is-gonzaga-baylor.html,sports,"Baylor knocked out its thoroughly overwhelmed opponent in the Final Four and cruised into the N.C.A.A. men’s championship game. Gonzaga was forced into overtime by a feisty, never-say-die underdog and needed a banked-in 3-pointer as time expired to remain undefeated and advance to the title game.,Exactly four months after they were supposed to meet in what was billed as a possible appetizer for the N.C.A.A. men’s final, Baylor and Gonzaga will settle things once and for all on Monday night at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The Bulldogs (31-0) have been made a 5-point favorite over the Bears (27-2) by sports books.,Gonzaga is seeking to become the first men’s team to finish unbeaten since Bob Knight’s Indiana club went 32-0 on the way to the 1976 national championship. The Bulldogs are also seeking their first N.C.A.A. title, though they have had plenty of deep tournament runs. They lost in the 2017 title game to a North Carolina team coached by Roy Williams, , and had three titles in his career.,Coach Scott Drew and Baylor are also seeking their program’s first national championship. The Bears are appearing in the title game for the first time since 1948.,“Amazing, we’ve worked hard through this struggle of a season but we stayed together,” guard Jalen Suggs, a Gonzaga freshman, said in a television interview after draining the game-winning shot ,.,“I can’t put this one into words, turning dreams into reality and now we get ready for Baylor,” Suggs said. “They’re a tough team.”,Even though Gonzaga has not lost since Feb. 22, 2020, against Brigham Young, the Bears have history on their side. This is just the fifth time since the Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll began in the early 1960s that the teams ranked No. 1 (Gonzaga) and No. 2 (Baylor) will meet in the title game. Each of the previous four games were won by the team ranked second: Cincinnati over Ohio State in 1962, U.C.L.A. over Michigan in 1965, UConn over Duke in 1999 and Duke over Arizona in 2001.,Led by Drew Timme’s 25 points, Gonzaga put up 56 points in the paint against U.C.L.A., and the Bears will have to have an answer for that. Baylor is led by experienced guards and wings, and its frontcourt players Mark Vital and Flo Thamba are solid if not spectacular.,Baylor is led by an all-American junior guard, Jared Butler, who had 17 points in the semifinal rout of Houston, and another junior guard, Davion Mitchell, who dished out 12 assists with 11 points ,. After last year’s tournament was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, both Butler and the senior guard MaCio Teague tested the N.B.A. draft waters but opted to come back for another shot at the title.,“That was one of my goals, and I know some of my teammates’ goals, just to leave a legacy at Baylor, create Baylor as a blue blood,” Butler said.,Larry Bird’s Indiana State team was 33-0 entering the 1979 title game against Magic Johnson and Michigan State.,Bird averaged 28.6 points, 14.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists a game during his junior season after averaging 30 points as a sophomore and nearly 33 as a freshman. In the national semifinal against DePaul, he made 16 of 19 field-goal attempts and had 16 rebounds and nine assists as Indiana State won, 76-74.,Michigan State featured not only Johnson, then a sophomore, but also Greg Kelser, a 6-foot-7 forward who was later chosen in the first round of the N.B.A. draft.,“We felt that our zone could affect them,” Johnson said on CBS before the semifinal games. “We double-teamed Larry every chance we got and we were able to pull off the victory,” 75-64.,Johnson, like many others in the basketball world, was hoping for a Gonzaga-Baylor final entering the Final Four.,“Gonzaga is such a well-balanced team, they can shoot from the outside, they got great inside players,” he said. “And that’s what we say with Baylor, they were dominant inside as well as outside.,“The best two teams in college basketball were Baylor and Gonzaga all season long.”,While Johnson went on to become the No. 1 pick in the 1979 N.B.A. draft, the 6-foot-4 Suggs is expected to be among the top three picks in this year’s draft on July 29.,Only one player in the last decade has won an N.C.A.A. championship and gone on to become the No. 1 pick over all: Kentucky’s Anthony Davis in 2012.,The Oklahoma State freshman point guard Cade Cunningham and the Southern California freshman 7-footer Evan Mobley are expected to be among the top picks along with Suggs, with many mock drafts projecting Cunningham at No. 1.,But Brian Sandifer, the director of the Grassroots Sizzle program for which Suggs played, believes the Minnesota native deserves to be the top pick in part because of his history of winning. As a quarterback for Minnehaha Academy, Suggs’s team went 25-1 and appeared in two state championships, winning one. He was recruited by Ohio State and Notre Dame, among others, to play football.,“Jalen Suggs is the best player in the draft, period,” Sandifer said in a phone interview. “I’ve never wavered from that. If you watch how they play and you do the résumé checks on all the kids, Jalen Suggs has won at every level that he’s played, football, basketball, whatever.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/sports/tennis/miami-open.html,sports,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — So what exactly happened at the Miami Open over the past two weeks?,Other than the top-seeded Ashleigh Barty walking away with the women’s singles title, something like tennis chaos unfolded at the only significant tournament in North America until August.,Where to begin? Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam event winner, lost a match for the first time in more than a year, and on a hardcourt, a surface it seemed she might never lose on again. After the men’s Big Three — Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — skipped this tournament, Jannik Sinner of Italy and Hubert Hurkacz of Poland, close friends and doubles partners, dueled in their first ATP Masters 1000 final. Hurkacz blew past Sinner, a player experts have tapped to be an eventual No. 1, 7-6 (4), 6-4.,Barty and Bianca Andreescu, who won Grand Slam events in 2019 but barely played in 2020, gave notice they were just about fully back as they met for the first time in the women’s singles final. A 20-year-old with top-class tennis DNA named Sebastian Korda, the son of the former world No. 2 Petr Korda, made the final eight and was the last remaining American.,The top two men’s seeds, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, lost in the quarterfinals. Alexander Zverev, the No. 3 seed, lost in the second round after having a bye in the first. Andrey Rublev was the only player in the top 10 of the ATP Tour rankings to make the semifinals, where he lost to Hurkacz in straight sets.,Simona Halep, the No. 3 women’s seed, and Sofia Kenin, the No. 4 seed, each won just a single match, and Maria Sakkari, the No. 23 seed, served a bagel to Osaka in the first set of her 6-0, 6-4 quarterfinal win.,In short, Miami provided a glimpse of a tennis future that does not include Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Serena Williams, who withdrew from the event after oral surgery: a sport of surprise and entropy.,“Everyone can win now,” Rublev said after his quarterfinal win over Korda. “It’s not about ranking.”,Rublev was talking about the tournament’s final rounds, but he could have meant the sport. Djokovic and Nadal are still nearly indomitable at big events, but when they skip one, all bets are off. (Federer, 39, has played just one tournament since his two knee operations last year.),Bernard Tomic of Australia said earlier this year that there was not much difference between a player ranked 60 and one ranked 250. It sounded strange, but now seems prescient.,Aslan Karatsev, a Russian qualifier, made the semifinals of the Australian Open. Juan Manuel and Francisco Cerundolo, two brothers from Argentina who are ranked outside the top 100, made the finals of tournaments in South America, with Juan Manuel winning a title. Lorenzo Musetti, 19, an Italian ranked 94th, knocked off two players in the top 16 at the Mexican Open.,Musetti, though, is only the second-best 19-year-old Italian at the moment: Sinner, the son of a cook and waitress and a surprise semifinalist at the French Open last year, is staking his claim as one of the brightest young players in the game.,“He has everything,” Roberto Bautista Agut, the veteran from Spain, said of Sinner after losing to him in three sets in the semifinals. “Big serve. Tall. Moves well. Very good groundstrokes. Mentally great, and he’s improving.”,Sinner is 6 feet 2 inches with long arms and legs that make him seem taller, and he has that priceless ability to pivot from defense to offense from nearly anywhere on the court and when his opponent least expects it. On three occasions against Bautista Agut, it looked like Sinner was about to wither, especially when he was down a set and three break points at 3-3 in the second set. Instead, he knotted the game with two winners, including a risky, floating crosscourt backhand that nicked the outside of the line.,“Every match has a story,” Sinner said after that win. Later, he said, “Sometimes a few points can decide a match.”,The Miami Open was an opportunity to show on a big stage what tennis could eventually look like.,“I knew when Novak, Rafa, Roger and Dominic Thiem said they were not going to play, some of the younger guys would have a chance to play really deep,” said Hurkacz, 24, a lanky, pigeon-toed big server who has won two tournaments this year.,Hurkacz, who often trains in Florida, was seeded 26th here, but he beat players seeded second, fourth, sixth and 12th in five days. He came back from a set and a service break down to Tsitsipas on a brutally hot day in the quarterfinal; outslugged Rublev in a gutsy performance, on a cool night in the semifinal; then knocked off the game’s latest boy wonder on a bright and breezy Easter afternoon.,Sinner served for the first set at 6-5, but Hurkacz broke him at love. Then a series of errors allowed Hurkacz to cruise through the tiebreaker. Hurkacz frustrated Sinner with a serve that kept kicking up above his eyes, and two early service breaks in the second set made the final result come fast.,Before the match, Sinner had begged off anointing himself the next big thing in tennis, cautioning that a good 10 days in Miami guaranteed nothing. “The road is long,” he said. “I know that. My team knows that.”,Barty, 24, and Andreescu, 20, also know that. The two young Grand Slam champions had never played head-to-head before Saturday’s final, though the showdown proved an anticlimax. Andreescu, who struggled to find her rhythm against Barty’s relentless groundstrokes, appeared to roll her foot and ankle while down, 2-0, in the second set and defaulted two games later, giving Barty her second consecutive Miami Open title, 6-3, 4-0.,Barty, the world No. 1 from Australia, opted not to play when tennis returned last August, because of her country’s strict quarantine requirements for anyone returning home during the pandemic. She played little tennis in 2020 from March until October, when she began to prepare for the Australian summer of tennis. She kept her top ranking only because of a pandemic rule change that allowed players to maintain their points from 2019.,She won a tuneup for the Australian Open, but lost in the quarterfinals of the Grand Slam event and in the first round of a tournament the next week. Barty has gained confidence. In Miami, she barely used the slices she tends to hit when she loses her edge. She does not plan to return to Australia until the fall so she can avoid the country’s mandatory two-week lockdown for international arrivals.,“I knew eventually I would find it,” Barty said of her form and the patience with which she approached her return to the game. “I knew it might not be in the third week or the 10th week or the 20th week.”,Andreescu, a Canadian, caught the injury bug shortly after winning the 2019 United States Open. It kept her from last year’s summer and fall events. In Australia, she showed flashes of her shotmaking prowess but was too inconsistent to play deep into events. In Miami, she prevailed in four three-set matches to make the final, surviving a third-set tiebreaker in the semifinal against Sakkari that finished past midnight. Then came another injury, a final twist in this strange tournament.,She tried to play through the pain, but eventually gave in to her trainer, Abdul Sillah, who urged her from courtside not to risk further damage. “Abdul basically saved me from myself,” said Andreescu, who crouched and cried when she knew the end had come.,With the Miami tournament over, the tours are planning to shift to the clay- and grass-court seasons in Europe, but events there are shrouded in uncertainty. Italy and France are in various stages of lockdowns as the European Union struggles to distribute the coronavirus vaccines. While organizers say the tournaments, the Italian Open and the French Open, which is the next Grand Slam event of the year, remain on track, it’s not clear whether government officials will allow them to take place.,While Nadal and Djokovic will no doubt quickly attempt to restore order, Federer has yet to say how much clay-court tennis he will play. His focus, he has said, is being healthy for Wimbledon.,Osaka, the winner of two of the last three Grand Slam events, has never won a tournament on those surfaces, leaving the door open for any number of her competitors to catch up to her.,“I have more freedom on the clay and grass because I am still learning a lot,” Osaka said last week.,In other words, expect more chaos."

Not at the former nursery in Georgia where youngsters and the top female amateurs convened for separate events at the invitation of the Augusta National Golf Club members who run the Masters Tournament, but across the country where a 21-year-old rookie, Patty Tavatanakit, won the ANA Inspiration on Sunday.,The 50th edition of the ANA Inspiration, the first of the five women’s golf majors of the year, will be remembered for Tavatanakit’s mastery of the course at Mission Hills Country Club and of the moment.,She led from start to finish to become the first rookie winner since Juli Inkster in 1984 and the first champion from Thailand in tournament history. She closed with a three-under 68 — her fourth consecutive sub-70 round — for a cumulative score of 18-under 270 to hold off a fast-closing Lydia Ko by two strokes. Ko’s 10-under 62 on Sunday was one of the most memorable final rounds in men’s or women’s major history.,With no fans on the course because of coronavirus restrictions, there were no roars to make Tavatanakit aware of what was happening in front of her. And she said she never once glanced at a leaderboard. “I didn’t feel the need to,” she said, adding, “I just wanted to play like it was another round of golf.”,Tavatanakit, who averaged more than 300 yards off the tee for the week, began the day with a five-stroke lead over the field and an eight-stroke advantage over Ko. For all the talk about Tavatanakit’s length, her touch on and around the greens proved clutch.,She chipped in for an eagle at the par-5 second, nearly chipped in two other times on the back nine and made an eight-foot putt to save par at No. 15 to keep Ko, the 2016 ANA Inspiration champion, at a club’s length.,Playing two groups ahead of Tavatanakit, Ko, 23, of New Zealand, applied more heat than a desert sun with a front-nine seven-under 29, a tournament record. She was nine under through 11, and climbed within two shots of the lead, but Tavatanakit did not wilt. Under the most intense pressure, Tavatanakit produced her second bogey-free round of the week.,“I felt like I gave myself a good run at it,” said Ko, whose last L.P.G.A. victory was in 2018, “but maybe Patty was just a bit too far away.”,Roughly 90 minutes before Tavatanakit teed off, Cristie Kerr put the finishing touches on a seven-under 65, her lowest round in 23 starts in the tournament. As Kerr signed her card in the scoring tent, she glanced up at a television tuned to Golf Channel, which was showing a replay of the Drive, Chip and Putt contest that had taken place earlier in the day at Augusta National.,Plastered on the glassed back wall, in direct view of the players as they reviewed their scorecards, were posters with sayings from former champions, including the three-time winner Amy Alcott, who said, “This tournament really got women’s sports on the move.”,The 43-year-old Kerr, who counts two major championships among her 20 tour titles, made her debut in this event as an amateur in 1996. Seventeen strokes off the pace at the day’s start, Kerr started in the fourth group in the morning and plotted her way around the course unburdened by expectations.,“All day I just kind of played with no fear,” Kerr said. “I’m thinking to myself, ‘Why doesn’t that happen every day?’”,The boldness of which Kerr spoke is Tavatanakit’s default mentality. Before sleeping on her first 54-hole lead in an L.P.G.A. Tour event, she said her mind-set Sunday would be, “Keep on the pedal.”,In 2019, in her second ANA Inspiration appearance, Tavatanakit earned low amateur honors, closing with a 68 to finish tied for 26th. She was a standout sophomore at U.C.L.A. at the time, but her presence at the event, a launching pad for amateurs long before Michelle Wie tied for ninth in 2003 as a 13-year-old, was not a given.,The inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur was being played at the same time. The opportunity it offered to play the final round on one of the world’s most storied courses had to be weighed against the chance to measure one’s game against the world’s most celebrated players.,Tavatanakit was one of a handful of eligible players who chose to bypass the amateur event to compete at Mission Hills. The decision, she said, questioned by many at the time, set Tavatanakit on a path that ended Sunday with her taking the winner’s traditional dip in Poppie’s Pond, the water hazard surrounding the 18th island green.,Her top 30 showing in 2019, she said, convinced her that she was ready to take a leap of faith. “I kind of had a thought of turning pro, I played well and that just made it more clear,” said Tavatanakit, who gave up her collegiate eligibility in May 2019.,By year’s end, Tavatanakit had won three times on the L.P.G.A.’s developmental tour. Her 2020 rookie season, which has been extended through 2021, featured a top five in February at the Gainbridge L.P.G.A., where she gained valuable experience playing in the last group with the eventual winner, Nelly Korda, but also seven missed cuts.,Tavatanakit suggested that her commitment to the ANA Inspiration in 2019 helped her immensely this year. The four rounds at Mission Hills in 2019 gave her enough course knowledge to commit to the aggressive lines she took.,“Looking back, I think coming here and playing here enough to know how the course is, it was really good,” she said.,Tavatanakit’s eyes were wet before she jumped into Poppie’s Pond. She became emotional before hitting her last putt, she said, because she was thinking, “Oh, man, I’m actually going to do this.”,She had made history and she had done it by grafting off women’s golf’s roots."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/sports/nba-jazz-jordan-clarkson-philippines.html,sports,"For the longest time, Paolo del Rosario felt alone. In the Philippines, he was that rare type of basketball fan: He rooted for the Utah Jazz.,He had adopted the team as a young boy in the late 1990s because he loved the two-man game of John Stockton and Karl Malone — and because the rest of his family, like many Filipino families, loved the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Lakers irritated him.,“I guess I just found them too loud,” he said.,Now a Manila-based ,, del Rosario, 30, remained on his own in his Jazz fandom for years until suddenly, about halfway through last season, he discovered that he was no longer on his own. The Cleveland Cavaliers had traded Jordan Clarkson to the Jazz, and del Rosario started receiving text messages from friends: “Hey, are you ready? You’re not going to be the only Jazz fan in the Philippines anymore.”,Even as the Jazz have gone about their business of building the best record in the N.B.A. this season, they have struggled to escape the long shadows cast by glitzier rivals. Beloved in Utah, the Jazz do not exactly have a global following.,The one clear exception, though, is their growing presence in the Philippines, , where the 28-year-old Clarkson, who identifies as Filipino-American, is a household name. His highlights flood social media.,“I’ll say this: If he doesn’t win sixth man of the year, I’m not sure the N.B.A. is ready for the online reaction from this part of the world,” said Nikko Ramos, the editor in chief of ,.,In the Philippines, where, because of the time difference, many people wake up with breakfast and basketball, fans are getting a heaping serving of Clarkson to go with their tapsilog and pandesal.,“N.B.A. League Pass is your best friend here,” Ramos said.,Fans have spent 45 percent more time on the streaming service watching Jazz games this season than they did last season, according to the league. And on the N.B.A. Philippines Facebook page, Clarkson-related posts outperform all other content by an average of three to four times. A video of his highlight from a win over the Los Angeles Clippers in December has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.,Clarkson clips have become a part of the morning ritual for Gabe Norwood’s three young sons, who have more of a direct connection to the shooting guard than most do: Their father has played with him on the Philippine national team, known as ,.,“My kids get ready for school by watching N.B.A. games rather than cartoons,” said Norwood, a longtime small forward for the Rain or Shine Elastopainters, one of 12 teams in the ,.,Clarkson, who is having the best season of his seven-year career, averaging more than 17 points per game, said he was acutely aware of his Filipino roots growing up in San Antonio. His maternal grandmother, Marcelina Tullao, made sure of it. She told stories about Pampanga, the province northwest of Manila where she was born, and made traditional dishes like chicken adobo and lumpia.,Those meals helped him feel a connection to the place, one that grew stronger as he got older — and one that eventually led him to develop a friendship with Norwood, who also grew up in the United States but has become a bit of ,.,“If there’s a Filipino somewhere playing hoop, Gabe finds them and acts as a big brother to them almost by default,” Ramos said.,Norwood, whose mother’s side of his family is Filipino, played at George Mason, where, as a junior, he came off the bench for , in 2006. The Final Four typically doubles as a coaching convention, and a couple of coaches from the Philippines approached Norwood’s mother one afternoon. Did she have a son playing in the tournament? “Sure enough, she did: No. 5 for George Mason,” Norwood said.,The following summer, Norwood traveled to the Philippines with a sports ministry group called Athletes in Action, and he used the trip to network. After his senior season, he was named to the Philippine national team and signed a contract with , of the P.B.A. “I’ve been here ever since,” said Norwood, who met his wife, Lei, in the Philippines.,In the process, Norwood has become one of the country’s leading basketball evangelists, a staple of the national team since 2007 and an advocate for the sport. As such, he played a role in helping carve Clarkson’s path to Gilas Pilipinas.,Clarkson was still in college when Norwood heard about him from a friend. When Clarkson declared for the N.B.A. draft in 2014 following his junior season at Missouri, Norwood gave him a call and sent him a pair of Nike sneakers that had been a special release in the Philippines, part of the Kobe Bryant signature line. Clarkson said he wound up wearing them in his predraft workouts.,“I just wanted to give him a heads up in terms of the support he has out here,” Norwood said.,At the time, Clarkson was still fairly unknown in the Philippines. Ramos, for example, said he had never even heard of him until Norwood mentioned that there was a prospect of Filipino descent preparing for the draft.,“And I work in basketball,” Ramos said, “so for me not to have heard his name when he was at Mizzou, that sort of tells how much of a new name he was in the country’s consciousness.”,Clarkson became very famous very fast. A lot of that had to do with his joining the Lakers after he was a second-round draft pick in 2014. The Lakers are popular in the Philippines, where , — a superstar who made at least a half-dozen appearances in the country in his prime.,“So if the intention was to get Jordan as much instant popularity with the Filipinos as possible, that was the dream scenario,” Ramos said.,Clarkson also soon proved that he was a bona fide N.B.A. player, averaging 11.9 points per game as a rookie. The following summer, he made a trip to Manila — and ,. He had traveled to the country as part of an N.B.A. Cares initiative with several other players, including Trey Burke and Horace Grant. But it became apparent that Clarkson was the main attraction.,Ramos helped show Clarkson and Burke around. On one of their first nights there, Ramos took them to dine at one of the city’s trendiest clubs, though he had his concerns.,“I remember telling him, ‘Hey, are you sure you want to do this?’” Ramos recalled. “And Jordan was like: ‘I play for the Lakers, and I live in L.A. I’m used to getting some attention. It’ll be fine.’”,It was not fine. As the scene spiraled into something that resembled chaos, Ramos grabbed a towel to throw over Clarkson’s head — an ineffective disguise — and ushered him out of the building through a back door.,“We couldn’t walk 10 steps,” Ramos said. “Everyone knew he was in the country.”,They eventually made it to a late-night pizza spot, where the people waiting to order also recognized Clarkson. When they insisted that he jump to the front of the line, he bought slices for everyone.,“I just remember how much love everybody was showing me,” Clarkson said. “I didn’t know that people even knew I was Filipino.”,The country’s adoration for Clarkson, who has a Philippine passport, went to another level when he competed for Gilas Pilipinas at the 2018 Asian Games, and nearly led the team to an upset over China in group play. His grandmother would ,.,“For Filipino fans to actually see him play for our national team, it was almost surreal,” said del Rosario, the broadcaster and longtime Jazz fan.,Clarkson plans to return to Gilas Pilipinas in 2023, he said, when the team takes part in Olympic qualifying competitions, including the World Cup, which the Philippines is co-hosting. FIBA, the sport’s international organizing body, allows one naturalized player per team, though Clarkson said he was hopeful that FIBA would consider him a local player ahead of the next Olympic cycle. “I think that’s the big thing that’s being figured out right now,” he said.,For its part, FIBA has maintained that Clarkson is only eligible to compete for the Philippines as a naturalized player.,In any case, Clarkson has learned just how much Filipinos care. In the N.B.A. last season, players had the option of putting league-approved messages on their jerseys, and international players could display them in their native languages. Clarkson chose the word “Peace,” which caused a small uproar in the Philippines because he had not used the Filipino word for peace, “Kapayapaan.” It became such a hot topic that his father, Mike, went on Instagram to assure everyone that his son “continues to represent his Filipino roots with pride,” adding , for good measure. Clarkson said it had not even occurred to him that using the Filipino word was an option.,“I guess it was a little controversial,” he said.,Some industrious entrepreneurs around Manila took matters into their own hands by manufacturing bootleg Clarkson jerseys with “Kapayapaan” on the back. It proved to be a popular item. Del Rosario managed to get ahold of one. He was not alone."

I felt an emotion I’d nearly forgotten could exist while watching sports: joy. Pure, unadulterated joy.,Did you?,These tournaments marked a unique milestone. ,, the N.C.A.A. tournaments became the first big time American sporting events to be outright canceled because of the virus. Time has had its way with us ever since. It stretched and bent like toffee. Has it really been 12 months, or much, much longer? The shuttering of college basketball’s annual showcases happened with such a jolt, and caused such a shock, that it foreshadowed a year of daily, dreadful uncertainty.,Even as the pandemic raged, nearly every other significant sporting event in America ended up being played, in some form. Not long after the United States suffered its , coronavirus death, , inside the restricted-access landscape of Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla.

But you watched these shimmering championships with the gnawing feeling that they shouldn’t be happening with the virus still out of control.,Yet here we are. For all that is flawed about collegiate athletics, good fortune blessed this year’s N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments: They played out against a fresh backdrop. Infection rates, deaths and hospitalizations are down over all. Vaccines are arriving across the country, being pumped into more and more arms each day. Soon we’ll move past 20 percent of the ,, with the rate climbing fast. President Biden in March signed a $1.9 trillion relief package.,True, there remains much recovery work to be done.

Members of the men’s teams from Oklahoma and Georgia Tech tested positive, but not enough of them to force cancellations.,Will we stay vigilant amid the continued challenge? Or will we fall for the thinking of people like Kim Mulkey, the Baylor women’s coach, who said daily testing of teams should be suspended during the Final Four, just to ensure the last games went off without a hitch?,Both tournaments, played entirely in Indiana and Texas this year, breaking the tradition of spreading them across the country in the early rounds, have allowed fans to fill stadiums to a quarter of normal capacity. That’s a risky move. It’s also, unfortunately, in line with the overall trend in American sports.,Consider Major League Baseball, which , last week.
