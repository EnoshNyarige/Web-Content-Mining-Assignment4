https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/spread-coronavirus-vaccinated-76806052,lifestyle,"NEW YORK -- Can I still spread the   after I’m vaccinated? It’s possible. Experts say the risk is low, but are still studying how well the shots blunt the spread of the virus. The current   are highly effective at preventing people from getting seriously sick with COVID-19. But even if vaccinated people don’t get sick, they might still get infected without showing any symptoms. Experts think the vaccine would also curb the chances of those people spreading the virus. “A vaccinated person controls the virus better, so the chances of transmitting will be greatly reduced,” said Dr. Robert Gallo a virus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Among the evidence so far: Studies suggesting if people do get infected despite vaccination, they harbor less coronavirus in the nose than the unvaccinated. That makes it harder to spread. Trying to settle the question, the U.S. is starting a study of college students willing to undergo daily nasal swab testing. Given the uncertainty and the arrival of more contagious variants, experts say fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and social distance in public and when visiting with unvaccinated people at high risk for severe illness if infected. “We still have to be cautious,” Gallo said. “The vaccine is essential. But it is not a cure-all that ends the epidemic tomorrow.” Other factors can also affect the likelihood of a vaccinated person spreading the virus, including vaccination rates in the community and whether there’s an ongoing surge in cases locally. “We want to think it’s all or none, but it’s very situation-specific,” said Dr. Laraine Lynn Washer, an infectious disease expert at the University of Michigan. —— The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in         this series.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/google-wins-big-supreme-court-clash-oracle/story?id=76878814,politics,"In the multi-billion Supreme Court clash between two titans of tech,   emerged as the victor on Monday. In a 6-2   by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court said that Google's use of 11,000 lines of code -- copied without permission from Oracle's Java program -- to create the Android smartphone operating system -- constitutes fair use as a matter of law and does not require compensation. ""We assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable. But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,"" Breyer wrote. The decision reversed a lower court ruling in favor of Oracle, which had sought $9 billion in damages from Google for copyright infringement. The stakes in the case -- dubbed the ""copyright case of the century"" -- are significant for both companies, the software industry and everyday American investors. Millions of Americans' 401k retirement savings plans include investments in Google. Experts have said a decision in favor of Google, allowing the copying of code as ""fair use,"" could facilitate more rapid development of new consumer products and technological innovation -- essentially allowing companies to build on each other. But there could be a downside:  Some start-up companies fear the decision could harm their ability to turn a profit if giants like Google can swoop in and copy without compensation. Justice Clarence Thomas, in a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito, blasted the decision as ""anything but fair."" ""Oracle spent years developing a programming library that successfully attracted software developers, thus enhancing the value of Oracle’s products. Google sought a license to use the library in Android, the operating system it was developing for mobile phones. But when the companies could not agree on terms, Google simply copied verbatim 11,500 lines of code from the library,"" Thomas wrote. ""By copying Oracle’s work, Google decimated Oracle’s market and created a mobile operating system now in over 2.5 billion actively used devices, earning tens of billions of dollars every year. If these effects on Oracle’s potential market favor Google, something is very wrong with our fair use analysis,"" he wrote. Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the decision as she was confirmed to the bench after the case was argued. ""The Supreme Court’s clear ruling is a victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science,"" Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, said in a statement. ""The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers."" “The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater,"" Dorian Daley, Oracle's executive vice president and general counsel, said in response. ""The barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower.  They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can.  This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/south-dakota-governors-ban-transgender-athletes-center-emerging/story?id=76793497,politics,"A series of culture wars that are likely to resurface on future campaign trails appear to be emerging in several Republican-led states   of transgender rights, despite the next two cycles of elections being several  . South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem -- who is widely considered to be a possible 2024 presidential aspirant -- is the latest official to be at the center of debates surrounding a groundswell of bills that aim to ban transgender students from playing on school sports teams according to the gender with which they identify. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, similar types of bills have made their way through more than a dozen states, including   laws in Tennessee and Mississippi. Noem's attempt to take on the highly sensitive topic had a rocky start, despite her having expressed initial excitement at the prospect of ""defending women's sports"" in signing HB 1217 --  her state's version of a bill that sought to ban transgender women and girls from playing on female sport teams. This week, Noem killed that bill after failing to come to a compromise with state lawmakers regarding revisions to what she called ""serious drafting errors"" which she believes made the bill ""significantly different from any other state legislation pending across the country."" In a letter addressed to the state's legislative leaders on Monday, Noem expressed her concerns over the bill's language having consequences beyond protecting ""fairness in women's sports."" The concerns included worries that the bill would have ""turned any failure to make a sports team into a litigation hazard,"" while also implementing the need for parents to complete a yearly ""onerous paperwork requirement"" to identify school-aged children's genders and whether their child had taken performance-enhancing drugs. Noem also pointed to the bill's likely impact on collegiate athletics, which could have put state athletes at odds with the oversight implemented by national athletic organizations. ""South Dakota has shown that our student athletes can compete with anyone in the country, but competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics,"" Noem wrote in a series of recent tweets. ""While I certainly do not always agree with the actions these sanctioning bodies take, I understand that collegiate athletics requires such a system -- a fifty-state patchwork is not workable."" Although the South Dakota governor's two executive orders do not explicitly include references to transgender athletes, they do refer to ""current policies that allow males to participate in women's athletics."" Noem said the orders ""temporarily address the problem"" and that she wants to see a special legislative session come together in the coming months to further address these issues through legislation. While Noem and other supporters of similar efforts see these policies as vehicles for protecting their notions of fairness in women's sports, the political push in South Dakota appears to be at odds with the current number of trans athletes it would presumably impact. According to data provided by the Transformation Project, a transgender youth advocacy group in South Dakota, there are only a handful of trans athletes across the state -- among them are five trans male athletes and no trans girl athletes. The evolution of Noem's stance on her state legislature's initial bill opened the door for intraparty criticism. Some social conservatives like the Family Policy Alliance seized on her perceived presidential aspirations by implying that her decision to oppose the bill could have larger political repercussions. ""It's no secret that Gov. Noem has national aspirations, so it's time she hears from a national audience,"" the group wrote in a press release to supporters. Editors at  , a conservative news magazine, called Noem's moves a ""disappointing capitulation"" and alleged the governor engaged in ""a flagrant violation of her powers"" for making ""sweeping substantive changes rather than small stylistic ones"" in her executive orders. The editors went on to call it a ""classic case of a politician motivated by immediate financial incentives (in this case, avoiding expensive lawsuits and potential boycotts) acting rashly on an issue she knows and cares little about, only to quickly realize that this was drastically out of step with her party and her base, and then frantically set about justifying her decision."" Noem stood her ground in a subsequent   published by the magazine. As LGBTQ advocates laud the outcome of the political back and forth, they indicate more work needs to be done to address trans rights. ""Nobody wins when politicians try to meddle in people's lives like this. Nobody wins when we try to codify discrimination like this. We're thrilled with the decision by South Dakota lawmakers to kill this bill,"" said Jett Jonelis, an ACLU of South Dakota advocacy manager in a statement following the termination of HB-1217 earlier this week. Following Noem's announced executive orders, Jonelis pushed back on the governor's notion of protecting ""fairness in women's sports"" in a statement to ABC News. ""If Gov. Noem really wanted to protect fairness in women's sports, she would tackle the actual   such as severe underfunding, lack of media coverage, sexist ideologies that suggest that women and girls are weak, and  ,"" Jonelis said. For now, it appears that at least one factor in the legislative saga could offer room for common ground -- according to Jonelis, the South Dakota ACLU is also currently examining whether the governor ""exceeded her authority by issuing these executive orders."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/covid-tax-break-open-door-student-loan-forgiveness-76530331,lifestyle,"The tax break on college debt cancellations in the         COVID-19 relief package signed last week by President   has removed a potential roadblock to forgiving student loan debt:   . The provision won’t count any debt forgiven from Dec. 31, 2020, to Jan. 1, 2026, as income. Under one of the existing forgiveness programs (income-driven repayment), the amount forgiven is reported to the IRS as income and taxed according to the borrower’s         current tax bracket. Any debt forgiveness wouldn’t benefit borrowers if it led to an unaffordable tax bill, says Douglas Webber , associate professor of economics at Temple University. “I see this as one step closer to eliminating what would be not just a big potential downside, but a big public relations problem,” Webber says. The tax measure was adapted from the Student Loan Tax Relief Act spearheaded by Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and  , D-Mass. On March 6, Warren tweeted , “This clears the way for President Biden to #CancelStudentDebt without burdening student borrowers with thousands of dollars in unexpected  .” Experts say the tax relief measure could do just that. “Given the context and all the discussions about loan forgiveness, I think it’s likely that this is a nod from Congress to open up this door,” says Megan Coval, vice president of policy and federal relations at National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. Artem Gulish , senior policy strategist at Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, says the relief package was just a start for student loan borrowers. “This is the first thing the Biden administration is putting through; there is still the potential for forgiveness,” Gulish says. However, there still isn’t legislation or executive order that answers the big questions of “if,” “how much,” or “when” forgiveness could happen. WHAT YOUR BILL COULD LOOK LIKE WITHOUT A TAX BREAK Imagine there was no tax relief included in the stimulus package. Optimistically, let’s also look into a crystal ball and say you have $10,000 of student loan debt forgiven sometime this year. Your earnings are $68,000 (the approximate median in the U.S.), which means you fall within the 22% tax bracket. Next year when you pay taxes on 2021 income, the forgiven debt would be taxed at 22% and you would owe $2,200 on it. Without a tax break, forgiveness could also have pushed you into a higher tax bracket. Say you earned $85,525 — the high end of the 22% tax bracket — and had $10,000 forgiven, which pushed you into the next bracket. Since it’s a progressive tax system, you would end up paying 22% on your income, but 24% on that amount that spilled over into the higher tax bracket ($2,400 in this example). There are additional sacrifices on the lower end of the income spectrum, says Erica Blom , a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization. Sliding into a different tax bracket could result in loss of credits, such as the earned income tax credit or a child tax credit. “That could have been as bad or worse than asking someone to cough up an additional $1,000 in taxes,” Blom says. WHERE STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS STANDS Democratic lawmakers, a group of 17 state attorneys general and consumer rights advocates have all called on         Biden to cancel  up to $50,000 in federal student loans via executive order. The president has said that he backs $10,000 in blanket forgiveness for federal student loan borrowers through congressional action. During a CNN town hall on Feb. 16, he said that he doesn’t support $50,000 of forgiveness. Biden and his team have questioned whether he has the authority to call on the Department of Education to forgive debt through executive action. Advocates argue a president does have this power under the Higher Education Act. However, the Department of Education issued a legal memo in January stating that its secretary lacks authority to issue forgiveness. The 42.9 million federal student loan borrowers who collectively owe $1.57 trillion to the federal government stand to benefit from blanket forgiveness. Having $10,000 forgiven would wipe out debt entirely for 15 million student loan borrowers , according to a NerdWallet         analysis of federal student loan data. Neither forgiveness proposal would presumably benefit borrowers with private student loans or those with commercially held Federal Family Education Loan debt, who were left out of previous relief packages. However, the tax relief for forgiven debt could benefit private student loan borrowers whose debts are settled via bankruptcy. Meanwhile, federal student loan borrowers remain in an interest-free payment pause that began March 13, 2020, and extends through the end of September. EXISTING FORGIVENESS PLANS AND TAXES Although there are existing debt cancellation programs, the success rates and tax implications have varied. Public Service Loan Forgiveness offers tax-free debt cancellation for borrowers who are approved (only 2.2% of applicants have been so far , according to federal data). Loan amounts forgiven under Borrower Defense to Repayment — used if you’ve been defrauded by your school — aren’t taxed. And disability forgiveness also isn’t considered taxable income. Forgiveness is normally taxed for those enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan, which sets payments at a portion of your income and forgives debt after 20 or 25 years. So far, only 32 borrowers have received forgiveness through these repayment programs, according to March 2021 data obtained by the National Consumer Law Center. But most borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan won’t be eligible to benefit from forgiveness until 2035 at the earliest — well after the Jan. 1, 2026, e xpiration date on the tax-free provision in the new relief package. —————————————————————————————————— This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/vaccinated-travelers-pricier-hotels-flights-76785859,lifestyle,"The cost of travel will slowly rebound from historic lows as more people receive COVID-19 vaccinations and book long-deferred trips, according to industry experts. This time last year, air traffic in the U.S. plummeted, with 95% fewer travelers passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in April 2020 compared with April 2019. This reduced demand led to a corresponding decrease in airfare prices. The average cost of a domestic round-trip ticket in the second quarter of 2020 dropped 28% from the same period in 2019, down to $259, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Few travelers were monitoring these prices at the time since so few were booking flights. But now, with COVID-19 vaccinations opening the possibility of travel to millions more Americans each week , prices are once again set to change. If you’re one of those would-be travelers, experts cautiously advise booking your travel soon. Much remains uncertain, but prices are unlikely to return to 2020 levels. FLIGHT DEMAND SET TO TAKE OFF Experts who track travel deals and consumer interest say demand for airplane seats is likely to increase, driving prices back up. Domestic airfare prices are expected to rise 4%-5% every month until summer 2021, said Adit Damodaran, an economist with Hopper, a travel search tool. “A lot of that is based on the vaccination rollout.” And this increased demand might combine with decreased supply. Airlines scaled back routes and flight frequency in 2020, parking aircraft and furloughing staff. They may be slow to return capacity to pre-pandemic levels, even as bookings pick up steam. “Airlines are burning so much cash, so what we’re seeing is that they’re slowly expanding supply,” said Jesse Neugarten , who founded the flight deal newsletter Dollar Flight Club. “If we have to shut down travel again, they don’t want to get caught in a similar situation as they did in 2020.” HOTEL PRICES MAY RISE SLOWLY Hotel prices have also dropped during the pandemic, though not as uniformly. Room rates in February in New York City were down 37% year-over-year according to Hopper’s data, while small-town hotels saw only a 5% dip. This reflects a larger exodus from crowded cities during the pandemic. This pattern could reverse as vaccinated travelers flock back into metropolitan areas later in 2021, driving prices up. But tourism accounts for only part of travel demand. Business travel, which has all but ceased during the pandemic, will likely be slower to return. This could keep hotel prices low throughout 2021, especially in large cities. It could also suppress airfare prices somewhat, even as more tourists take to the skies. BOOKING FLEXIBILITY LIKELY TO CONTINUE Neugarten, who tracks flight deals, points to a changing travel landscape that extends beyond considerations of supply and demand. The pandemic changed how   and hotels handle flexibility, with many         eliminating change and cancellation fees altogether. This, in turn, has changed the logic for how and when to book travel. “I’m not going to book last-minute because I can get a good deal if I’m booking three months in advance,” Neugarten said. “There’s a lot of incentive to book a deal now because of the flexibility.” Furthermore, the travel trends that mark a typical year remain in flux. Memorial Day and July Fourth travel could follow unusual trends, especially in terms of when bookings will occur. “The traditional events of the year in travel are simply not happening, so there isn’t the same ‘best time to book’ that we would normally see,” said Mark Crossey, travel expert for Skyscanner , a flight search tool. And then there is the question of international travel. Many countries have limited tourists, particularly from the U.S., and these restrictions may remain even as more travelers receive vaccinations. “We’re not expecting an increase in prices for international airfare until May,” said Damodaran. And changing prices are unlikely to be geographically uniform, as countries update their policies one by one. Damodaran noted that Hopper is seeing the strongest interest in Caribbean and Latin American destinations. Uncertainties abound. Vaccine distribution hiccups could dampen prices, as could surges in COVID-19 variants. Flexible booking options, although good for customers, could lead to mass rebookings later in the year. And volatile oil markets could impact airfare prices, as they do in normal years. Despite these unknowns, experts remain cautiously confident that those looking to book 2021 travel should do so sooner rather than later. Greater flexibility reduces the risk of changing plans, and increased travel demand is unlikely to drive prices below current levels. “I booked a one-way (flight) to Portugal in July for $109,” Neugarten says. “We’ll see if I get the vaccination before. If not, I’ll push it out.” —————————————————————————————————————— This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet. Sam Kemmis is a writer at NerdWallet.

https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/vaccine-passport-efforts-draw-opposition-gop-lawmakers-76852995,lifestyle,"HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Vaccine passports being developed to verify COVID-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private   choices. They currently exist in only one state — a limited government partnership in New York with a private company — but that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers in a handful of states from rushing out legislative proposals to ban their use. The argument over whether passports are a sensible response to the pandemic or governmental overreach echoes the bitter disputes over the past year about masks, shutdown orders and even the   themselves. Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for COVID-19. They are in use in         Israel  and under development in parts of Europe, seen as a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic-         devastated travel industry. They are intended to allow businesses to more safely open up as the vaccine drive gains momentum, and they mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases. But lawmakers around the country are already taking a stand against the idea. GOP senators in Pennsylvania are drawing up legislation that would prohibit vaccine passports, also known as   certificates or travel passes, from being used to bar people from routine activities. “We have constitutional rights and health privacy laws for a reason,” said Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican. “They should not cease to exist in a time of crisis. These passports may start with COVID-19, but where will they end?” Benninghoff said this week his concern was “using taxpayer money to generate a system that will now be, possibly, in the hands of mega-tech organizations who’ve already had problems with getting hacked and security issues.” A Democratic colleague, Rep. Chris Rabb of Philadelphia, sees value in vaccine passports if they are implemented carefully. “There’s a role for using technology and other means to confirm people’s statuses,” Rabb said. “But we do have concerns around privacy, surveillance and inequitable access.” Republican legislators in other states have also been drafting proposals to ban or limit them. A bill introduced in the Arkansas Legislature on Wednesday would prevent government officials from requiring vaccine passports for any reason, and would ban their use as a condition of “entry, travel, education, employment or services.” The sponsor, Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, called vaccine passports “just another example of the Biden administration using COVID-19 to put regulations or restrictions on everyday Americans.” President Joe Biden's administration has largely taken a hands-off approach on vaccine passports. At a news conference this week, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he considered them a project for the private sector, not the government. He said the government is considering federal guidelines to steer the process surrounding vaccine passports. Among its concerns: Not everyone who would need a passport has a smartphone; passports should be free and in multiple languages; and private health information must be protected. ""There will be organizations that want to use these. There will be organizations that don’t want to use these,” said Dr. Brian Anderson of Mitre, which operates federally funded research centers and is part of a coalition working to develop standards for vaccine certifications to make their use easier across vendors. Anderson noted the Vaccination Credential Initiative is not making recommendations on how — or even if — organizations choose to use the certifications. In Montana, GOP lawmakers this week voted along party lines to advance a pair of bills that would ban discrimination based on vaccine status or possession of an immunity passport, and to prohibit using vaccine status or passports to obtain certain benefits and services. And a freshman Republican state lawmaker in Ohio spoke out about the concept, saying more restrictions or mandates are not the answer to every COVID-19 problem. “Ohioans are encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccine for the health and well-being of themselves and others,” Rep. Al Cutrona said. “However, a vaccine should not be mandated or required by our government for our people to integrate back to a sense of normalcy.” Republican Florida Gov. Ron         DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order that said no governmental entity can issue a vaccine passport, and businesses in that state can't require them. He said he expected the Legislature to pass a similar law. His order said requiring ""so-called COVID-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life — such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater — would create two classes of citizens.” U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a newly elected member who has embraced and promoted a range of far-right political positions, told her supporters on Facebook earlier this week that “something called a vaccine passport” was a form of “corporate communism” and part of a Democratic effort to control people’s lives. And a GOP lawmaker in Louisiana has teed up a bill to keep the state from including any vaccination information on the Louisiana driver’s license or to make issuance of a driver’s license subject to vaccine status. In         New York, a government-sponsored vaccine passport called the Excelsior Pass is being introduced. A smartphone app, it shows whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for COVID-19. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the idea as letting an event venue usher, for example, use their own smartphone to scan a concertgoer’s code. New York officials have not released specific details about how the app will work, access someone’s vaccination or testing status or protect a user’s name, date of birth or the location where their code was scanned. The app’s privacy policy says data will be “maintained in a secure manner” and won’t be used for sales or marketing purposes or shared with a third party. But some privacy experts say the public needs more specifics to ensure its information is protected. Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center, a New York–based civil rights and privacy group, warned the Excelsior Pass creates a new layer of surveillance without sufficient details about how it collects data or protects privacy. ""We basically only have screenshots of the user interface and not much more,” Cahn said of Excelsior Pass. ——— Associated Press writers Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus, Ohio; Marina Villeneuve in Albany, New York; Candice Choi in New York; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; Amy Beth Hanson in Helena, Montana; and Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed."

""I said 'whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute, I love Kamala she's my sister,'"" she said. ""'She's brilliant, and she and I came into the Senate together. And she is as Asian as I am, we're both half Asian. But you would never say to the Black Caucus, you have Kamala, there's no need to nominate any more members of the Black community to key Cabinet positions. I mean, you wouldn't even say, hey, you've got a white male president, there's no need to have any more white males in the Cabinet -- right? So why would you say that to Asians?'"" ""I think that is illustrative of the otherness (in how) AAPI's have been treated in this country,"" she added. ""And I do talk about that in the book where I say, you know, you're always sort of like the other. You're always having to prove that you're American enough, that you're part of this country."" The Illinois senator's new memoir, ""Every Day is a Gift,"" came out March 30. The book shares stories from her life including her recovery after an RPG shot down her helicopter in Iraq and took both of her legs. She also discusses her experiences as a senator, including ""Babygate,"" when she fought to bring her newborn onto the floor of the Senate, and her experience as an Asian American woman in America. Duckworth raised the issue of diversity in Biden's Cabinet following an increase   since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. ""And I will tell you that the White House heard me,"" she said. ""They responded within 24 hours, and they said 'absolutely, and we're starting by putting a very senior staffer in the West Wing who will have the ability to say to the president or have the ability to say to his key advisers, 'wait a minute, you've overlooked this,' and that person will be of AAPI descent.'"" Duckworth also discussed President Joe Biden's  n on ""Powerhouse Politics."" The proposal, which is expected to cost $2 trillion, includes funding for modernizing transportation infrastructure, eliminating lead pipes and expanding broadband access. ""This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime efforts that is going to really bring America back to the status of a global leader economically and creates just so many jobs in this country that are so badly needed right now,"" she said. Duckworth said parts of the plan will pay for themselves, like fixing leaking water pipelines. She added that the plan could be paid for through increasing the gas tax, although a gas tax increase is not in Biden's proposal. ""It was actually the trucking industry that came to us and said 'we're spending more money stuck in road congestion and fixing and repairing our trucks because of the bad quality of the streets in this country,'"" Duckworth said. ""'We would rather raise the gas tax, and pay that because that will save us money in the long run.'"" When Karl pressed Duckworth on the gas tax, noting that it would impact all Americans, including those with low incomes, she pointed to tax credits as a way of alleviating that pain. ""I don't have a problem with going and revoking the tax cuts for the ultra-rich and for large corporations that the Republicans passed just a few years ago. That will not affect working families in this country,"" Duckworth said. ""So there are ways to do this. I'm happy to be bipartisan about it, but the key thing here is that if we don't do this, it's going to cost us more in the long run, in terms of losses to businesses, in terms of where the country will be, in terms of not having the jobs that we need."" Duckworth also shared her experience during the Jan. 6 insurrection and connected it to the title of her book, which she called ""a love letter to America."" ""Betrayal is the best that I can describe how I felt and how I still feel today,"" she said. ""But after all that, this democracy, this country, despite all of our divides and what happened then, is still worth it. We are-- it's still worth working towards that more perfect union."""

""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives. That is wrong,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo sent to all Delta employees worldwide. His   praised aspects of the new law, and said it ""improved considerably during the legislative process."" Hours later, Coca-Cola's CEO joined Delta's in condemning the legislation, calling it a ""step backwards"" in an interview with CNBC. ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied, and we will continue to advocate for it, both in private and now even more clearly in public,"" Quincy said. ""The reality is many things are improved and done and achieved in private without having to take a public stand, but in this case, it does not work, clearly, and so we're being more forceful in our public position."" Quincy's rebuke went much further than another top Coca-Cola executive's did in a   Monday. Coca-Cola did not take a public stance on the bill before it passed, but Monday's statement said the company was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Since Gov. Brian Kemp signed the Republican-sponsored   into law Thursday evening, voting rights activists from a broad coalition of more than 50 groups have ramped up their   Georgia-based businesses. Some leaders are even calling for boycotts. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter -- one of the coalition groups leading on this issue -- told ABC News Wednesday she was glad that Delta and Coca-Cola changed their stance, and while she said the work is harder now because the bill has passed, she believes these corporations have the ""political muscle"" to make a difference not just in Georgia, but nationwide. ""I'm hoping that they really do recognize ... that not coming out earlier was a missed opportunity, but that in fact they have an opportunity now,"" Brown said. ""(They can) send a clear message that as a company, they adamantly stand against the bills in Georgia and all bills that seek to suppress the vote, and that they're going to use their political capital and leverage to actually prevent voter suppression and stand for democracy."" Delta and Coca-Cola's repositioning also comes as 72 Black executives penned an open letter, which ran as a full-page ad in Wednesday's  , calling on corporate America  to stand in public opposition to any legislation that would restrict voting access, and specifically, Black voters' access to the ballot. ""Make no mistake, we have seen this playbook before,"" the letter read. ""As Black business leaders, we cannot sit silently in the face of this gathering threat to our nation's democratic values and allow the fundamental right of Americans, to cast their votes for whomever they choose, to be trampled upon yet again."" Before the Georgia bill passed, activists had called on major corporations based in the Peach State to publicly oppose the omnibus elections bills being considered by the General Assembly, which they said was directly aimed at suppressing Black voters and other historically disenfranchised communities. But most corporations did not, instead opting to issue general statements supporting fair, accessible and secure elections. Delta and Coca-Cola received much of the post-signing blowback. Wednesday morning, before the executives articulated clearer positions against the bill, Hannah Gebresilassie, a co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News that both companies' ""watered-down statements"" were ""extremely disappointing."" ""We expect them to stand up for people across this nation, when injustices are facing our lives,"" Gebresilassie said. ""We want to see Coca-Cola and Delta put their money where their mouth is. Y'all better be helping pay for voter mobilization efforts in the next few months because we have a lot of educating to do with this bill being passed."" On Wednesday afternoon, a group of voters, Black church leaders and activists from Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and #ProtectTheVoteGA held a rally in front of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, whose president and CEO   of support for several provisions of the bill, but recognized that ""concerns remain."" Despite the rain, the demonstrators showed up to demand accountability from business leaders on the issue of voting rights. Attendees handed out water to people walking in and out of the building, which under the new elections law volunteers can no longer do for voters waiting in sometimes hours-long lines. Other provisions in the bill that activists have blasted include a shortened early voting period for runoffs, a ban on out-of-precinct voting until 5 p.m., limitations on ballot drop box accessibility and the new ability for voters to make an unlimited number of challenges to other voters' eligibility. Some of the same Georgia corporations being targeted over the elections law responded stood united with the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, when activists and allies protested against racial injustice following George Floyd's death in police custody. Both Coca-Cola and Delta came out in support of that racial reckoning. A ""Black Lives Matter""   at Delta's headquarters. Coca-Cola made a racial equity commitment plan, and a   is still on the company's Twitter account. ""They need to understand how strong the correlation is, right? If you're saying Black lives matter, you also need to say that Black votes matter,"" Crystal Greer, the other co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News. Brown said companies joining the movement that followed Floyd's death was a ""positive move forward,"" but she said now, companies who did so need to make clear that it was not a ""marketing exploitation opportunity."" ""It is one thing to in the heat of the moment, to say that I stand and I acknowledge this is wrong (but) I think it also has to be more than transactional. It has to be a transformative change,"" Brown said. ""What are their values as companies around racial justice and racial equity? What are they willing to give, but what are they willing to give up?"""
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/pbs-kids-celebrates-autism-awareness-month-friends-76811142,lifestyle,"NEW YORK -- A new child is introduced this month on the animated TV show “Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum” who is a little different. He's sensitive to loud noises and he likes doing things his way, in his time. Ben is autistic and he helps teach the show's regular cast about acceptance. “People think and do things differently. And that's OK,” says star Yadina after learning about Ben's specialness. The 11-minute episode has the blessing of no less than Temple Grandin, the professor at Colorado State University and trailblazing spokesperson for people with autism. In the episode, the three friends Xavier, Yadina and Brad go to their secret museum and back in time to meet Grandin as a child to better understand her condition and how to make a connection with Ben. “It was wonderful. Absolutely wonderful,” Grandin said recently via Zoom. “I think things like this show are really good on educating elementary school kids about differences and inclusion.” The episode — premiering Monday — is one of several ways PBS Kids is celebrating         Autism Awareness Month. The Emmy-winning “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” and new superhero series         “Hero Elementary” also shine spotlights on characters with autism. On         “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” viewers are introduced to Max, who avoids loud sounds and is comforted by a heavy blanket. He likes buses and bugs and plays to his own rhythm. “Some things about him are different than you,” a teacher explains. “We’re excited for him to premiere and hopefully more kids will feel represented through our show. That’s a big reason, I think, behind doing this,” said Chris Loggins, supervising producer of “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” from Fred Rogers Productions. Children diagnosed with autism face social communication challenges and often exhibit restricted, repetitive behaviors. In 2020, the CDC reported that approximately 1 in 54 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls. The PBS Kids’ animated series “Hero Elementary” last year introduced a diverse group of four superhero students who are learning to master their special powers, including the character of AJ Gadgets, who is on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. AJ doesn’t like loud noises or wet clothes or to be apart from his beloved backpack. But he’s part of the team and always comes to the rescue. Max, AJ and Ben represent autistic children on the spectrum, but the vastness of the range of developmental abilities means they can't portray all children. The creators hope that even if the characters don't match up one-to-one with the viewer, they can at least offer representation. Max represents the first time an autistic character has been highlighted on “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” and the creators consulted autism experts and child development specialists. He fits neatly into an ongoing theme of the show which teaches that all people have unique needs and that friends can help. “It was important for us to introduce this character, Max, authentically and with care, but the social and emotional message of the episode I think can apply to all of us,” said Loggins. For Grandin, she got a kick out of being represented on “Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum” alongside other heroes of history like Marie Curie, Neil Armstrong and Eleanor Roosevelt. ""I’m really honored to have such esteemed company,"" she joked. Her episode shows her unique empathetic approach to understanding animals and her special way of flying a kite — attaching it to a bicycle. She notes that she's a visual thinker and autistic people are often natural fixers. “The thing is, differences bring different skills,” she added. “Each different kind of mind brings different skills to the table and these different thinkers can be complementary.” ——— Mark Kennedy is at         http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-rita-hart-ends-election-challenge-close-iowa/story?id=76796759,politics,"Democrat Rita Hart announced she's withdrawing her challenge to the results in Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, ending a   over the last contest of the 2020  . Hart dropped her petition before the House panel tasked with overseeing the review, according to a statement released Wednesday, amid intense pressure from both sides. ""After many conversations with people I trust about the future of this contest, I have made the decision to withdraw my contest before the House Committee on Administration,"" she said, citing ""the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years."" ""It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility,"" she added. GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was   in November by a mere six votes out of 400,000 cast, marking one of the closest House races in modern history. She was seated with the rest of Congress in early January, taking the oath of office and representing the southeastern Iowa district despite Hart moving forward with a petition in the House. Hart asked the House panel in December to probe the results after a recount and certification, bypassing the courts and calling for a hand recount of all votes -- including 22 ballots that were excluded from the official tally. Her legal team centered their case on those excluded ballots, saying that they were legally cast and should be counted and would ultimately hand her a victory if they were included. ""Since Election Day, and throughout this entire process, my mission has been about ensuring the voices of Iowans who followed the law are not silenced. I am saddened that some Iowans’ votes will not count through no fault of their own. The work of ensuring it does not happen again will continue beyond this campaign,"" Hart said in the statement ending her challenge. But a pursuit in Congress was a politically fraught maneuver, with Republicans mounting a pressure campaign against Democrats for trying to reverse the election outcome and framing the challenge as an attempt by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to ""steal"" a Republican seat and pad her slim majority. ""The race is over. I understand people get upset when they lose, but the idea that you want to come in and play a political game is concerning to me,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a press conference in Iowa, just hours before Hart's announcement. ""We have elections and people need to have trust and faith and confidence in their elections,"" Miller-Meeks said earlier on Wednesday alongside McCarthy. ""If six votes aren't enough to win an election, then why are six members on a committee able to overturn an election."" After Hart officially dropped her challenge, McCarthy celebrated Miller-Meeks' victory, saying in a statement, ""Rita Hart and Nancy Pelosi finally heard what many Iowans told me today: Mariannette Miller-Meeks is the duly-elected Congresswoman serving Iowa’s Second Congressional District."" The GOP's efforts to cast Democrats as trying to invalidate certified election results comes after spending months supporting former President Donald Trump's attempt to reverse his electoral defeat last year. McCarthy voted alongside 138 House Republicans against certifying the presidential results from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Democrats, including Pelosi, pushed back by drawing a contrast between Hart's challenge -- which followed a legal process outlined by federal law and focused on 22 ballots to back up their claims -- and Trump's fruitless effort based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud. Throughout the protracted process, one of the most significant wrinkles for Democrats was within their own ranks, as some moderate members balked at the prospect of overturning the election results if a vote came to the House floor. ""Losing a House election by six votes is painful for Democrats. But overturning it in the House would be even more painful for America. Just because a majority can, does not mean a majority should,"" Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn.,   earlier this month. It's not unusual for an election to be contested before the obscure committee: there have been 110 cases filed since 1933. But overturning an election is a rare outcome: over nearly 90 years, only three of those cases resulted in the declared winner being removed and replaced, according to the committee, and in one, the seat was left vacant. New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm who is charged with defending Democrats' majority in next year's midterm elections, said in a statement after Hart's announcement that he respects the former Iowa state senator's decision and pledged that Democrats will continue to fight for voters. ""From the day she announced her candidacy, Rita Hart has shown that she is a tireless advocate for the people of Iowa. I respect her decision and applaud her efforts to ensure that every legal vote was counted in this election. I know her service and commitment to Iowans won't end here,"" Maloney said. ""While Republicans have been throwing up roadblocks to the ballot box at every turn, Democrats will always fight to ensure every American can vote and that every legal vote is counted."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/feds-florida-investigation-rep-gaetz-sources/story?id=76796794,politics,"The federal investigation into Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is focused on allegations that the junior congressman had a sexual relationship with at least one minor, and is scrutinizing the Republican's conduct not only in Florida but outside the politician's home state too, three sources familiar with the investigation tell ABC News. The investigation, first reported by the New York Times Tuesday and  , has sent shockwaves through Republican circles, particularly among close associates of former President  , who considered Gaetz a staunch ally and loyal friend. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Sources told ABC News the investigation has been going on for months and began during the Trump administration. Former Attorney General Bill Barr was briefed on the investigation's progress several times, the sources said. One source told ABC News that federal authorities have already interviewed multiple witnesses as part of their probe. Gaetz has reportedly told confidants he is considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax, according to   earlier Tuesday. Yet within the last several weeks Gaetz started reaching out to prominent attorneys, according to one source. The source said that one of the attorneys Gaetz asked to represent him was Washington attorney Bill Burck, who represented Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and Don McGahn during the Mueller probe. Burck turned down the case, according to a person familiar with the decision. On Fox News Tuesday night, Gaetz appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. The law offices of Beggs & Lane, where McGee is now employed as a private attorney, denied those allegations in a statement Wednesday night. ""The allegation by the Congressman is both false and defamatory,"" the statement read. ""Mr. McGee was the Chief Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida 25 years ago. During his tenure with the Department of Justice his reputation for integrity and ethical conduct was impeccable. It has remained impeccable throughout his 25 year tenure with our firm. While he was with the DOJ he would never have entertained a scheme such as what Congressman Gaetz suggests nor would he today. Unsubstantiated allegations do not change that fact."" One source familiar with the matter confirmed that the FBI and Justice Department are separately investigating Gaetz's allegations that he was the target of an extortion attempt."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-big-push-massive-infrastructure-plan-proposed-tax/story?id=76770525,politics,"President   on Wednesday unveiled what he has called his  , a roughly $2 trillion   plan to modernize thousands of miles of roads, fix thousands of bridges, expand broadband access and replace all lead pipes carrying drinking water. ""It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh. ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II."" To pay for it, he is proposing trillions of dollars in   on corporations -- making a traditionally bipartisan issue one expected to trigger Republican opposition. He said he would invite Republicans to the Oval Office and ""listen to them"" and their ideas about how to pay for his proposals. The president also faces headwinds from progressive Democrats who do not think the spending package is large enough, as well as more centrist Democrats who feel the opposite. Balancing their competing interests will prove essential as the Democratic leadership pushes a bill through a Congress it only very narrowly controls. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues Monday she hopes to pass it by July 4, if not later that month, according to a person familiar with her comments. ""I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say, 'This was the moment that America won the future,'"" Biden said Wednesday, decrying the state of U.S. infrastructure compared to other countries. ""What I'm proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America's future, spread largely over eight years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally and create more revenue as well."" Biden's spending plan, he said, will create millions of jobs. He detailed the first part during a speech in industry- and union-centric Pittsburgh, where he also kicked off his campaign in 2019, pledging to restore the middle class. ""Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to 'rebuild the backbone of America,'"" Biden said, calling himself a ""union guy."" ""And today, I return as your president to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that."" The president proposed pairing the decade's worth of spending with a series of tax hikes on corporations, which the White House said will pay the full infrastructure costs over 15 years. Biden proposes raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a return to the level before the 2017 GOP rewrite of the tax code. His plan would also increase taxes on multinational companies' profits abroad and would eliminate subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, among other ideas. On a call with reporters Tuesday night, an administration official wouldn't say if Biden plans to send one entire package or separate proposals to Congress. The official also wouldn't say when any of the proposed infrastructure projects could potentially get started. When asked how many jobs the proposal -- which is being called the ""American Jobs Plan"" -- would create, the official would not provide a specific number, only saying it would ""create millions and millions of jobs."" Biden said he planned to roll out a second component of his proposal later in April, which press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday would center on ""creating economic security for the middle class through investments in child care, health care, education and other areas."" That part could total more than $1 trillion in additional spending, according to people familiar with a Tuesday briefing for top senators on congressional committees who will be involved in crafting the package. In recent months, Biden has signaled that he would pay for future spending proposals by raising taxes not just on corporations but on wealthy individuals, too. Biden had previously said that Americans making over $400,000 per year would see their taxes increase and that he supported taxing capital gains as normal income, which are not among the ideas the White House proposed this week. An administration official told ABC News that ""the focus of this plan is on corporate tax reform,"" and Biden reiterated Wednesday that those making less than $400,000 annually would not see an increase. ""No one, let me say it again, no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period,"" he said. ""This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American -- in American capitalism."" It's possible that those tax proposals could appear alongside next month's spending proposal. The package is separated into four areas: transportation, home, care and research-and-development infrastructure. Among the proposals is $621 billion in updates to modernize roads, rails, ports, airports, mass transit and highways; $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes; $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country; $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans and a $180 billion investment in clean energy. It also includes $174 billion to spur job growth in the electric-vehicle market and create a national network of 500,000 electric-vehicle chargers by 2030. ""They are among the highest-valued investments that we can make in the nation,"" Biden said, arguing they would improve the country's competitiveness. He invoked the space program more than once, noting nearly 2,000 impactful products and services it generated and implored Americans ""to imagine again"" ""The rest of the world is closing in, and closing in fast,"" Biden said. ""We can't allow this to continue. An American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal, non-defense research and development spending on record."" As president-elect, Biden laid out ""a two-step plan of rescue and recovery"" -- the first, his   relief proposal, a version of which became law this month, and the second, what he called his ""Build Back Better"" plan. That plan, he said in January, ""will make historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy. Investments in the caregiving economy and in skills and training needed by our workers to compete and win the global economy of the future."" Biden has prioritized the major spending plan, the first half of his package, as he seizes on any early momentum after pushing the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package through Congress. But with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the House -- he can only afford to lose eight Democratic votes -- and an evenly split Senate, it remains to be seen whether the infrastructure package could pass through Congress. While improving airports and roads typically find bipartisan support, the Biden administration's plans to fund improvements through tax increases could turn off most, if not all, Republicans, and potentially even some Democrats. The coronavirus relief package was popular among Americans, including Republicans, but it did not garner a   in Congress. As it did with the relief package, the White House has similarly leaned into popular support for infrastructure improvements -- a sign it is prepared to use, and will try to shape, public opinion as a cudgel to bring lawmakers on board. Another threat came this week from several New York-area House Democrats who want to see Biden lift the cap on the deduction for state-and-local taxes, known as SALT, imposed by a law then-President Donald Trump signed in 2017. Doing so would benefit suburban homeowners, although some progressive Democrats could balk at the notion of a tax change that would benefit relatively wealthier Americans. ""If SALT is not included, I'm not voting for any changes to the tax code,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., told ABC News this week. ""We all put our different interests about different issues on the back burner for the American Rescue Plan because it was so important that we all come together on it."" On Tuesday, Suozzi issued a statement with two other Democrats, Reps. Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, opposing any deal that does not reverse the cap on the SALT deduction. ""We say, 'No SALT, no deal,'"" they said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, too, on Wednesday said he would ""fight hard"" to get the SALT deduction caps lifted, although the New Yorker backed Biden's infrastructure plan and touted the jobs the White House said it would create. Biden's plan does not reverse the cap on SALT deduction. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Tuesday that the group would not take a position on lifting the cap, but added, ""I'm not sure that our members will see it as some of the fundamental reforms to the tax system that would make the system more fair."" The White House has indicated that Biden would be willing to negotiate on potential new taxes that are sure to be unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats alike. ""The president has a plan to fix our infrastructure and a plan to pay for it,"" Psaki said Monday. ""But we are also open to having that discussion, and we certainly expect to have the discussion with members of Congress, as we move forward, about areas where they agree, where they disagree, where they would like to see greater emphasis or not."" Biden has said he wants to attempt to pass a major infrastructure package as his second priority -- before legislation on immigration or gun reform, for example -- because he thinks the current, divisive political climate may be more tolerant of a spending plan could help the United States ""compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs."" ""It's a matter of timing,""   last week. But if Republican support does not materialize this time either, Schumer's office this week hinted at the possibility Democrats in that chamber could try to push through the president's proposals through a budgetary process known as ""reconciliation"" -- the same way they passed Biden's COVID-19 relief bill. That process would allow for a simple majority -- including Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote -- to pass Biden's bills, unlike the 60 votes normally needed. But that step would require the support of all 50 Senate Democrats -- far from guaranteed after centrists have expressed a desire for prioritizing bipartisanship this time around. Asked on Tuesday night's call if the White House hopes to use reconciliation to push the package through, an administration official would only say, ""this is the beginning of a process"" and would be reaching out to Republicans and Democrats. Biden could also face competing pressures inside his party on the overall size of the package, with Jayapal and other progressives encouraging the White House to think bigger. ""The Biden proposal on the campaign trail was significantly larger than what's been discussed so far,"" Jayapal said. ""We really think there's ample room to get the overall number up to somewhere in that range (of $6.5 trillion and $11 trillion over the next 10 years) in order to really tackle the scale of investment that we need to make."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/matt-gaetzs-controversial-rise-maga-stardom-faces-renewed/story?id=76799913,politics,"In 2017, both chambers of Congress passed an anti-human-trafficking bill that provided more funds to protect vulnerable women. The vote was nearly unanimous, minus one lone holdout: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz's vote at the time puzzled his new colleagues in Congress, and days later, he took to Facebook to defend it on a live stream from his parents' living room. ""I assure you it's not because I don't think human trafficking is a problem,"" he declared. ""It absolutely is. But far too often the best of intentions can lead to mission creep at the federal level."" The conservative rising star, who spent the past three years drawing the spotlight by cutting against the grain, now finds himself gaining attention he didn't seek. And again, the subject is human trafficking. Gaetz sits at the center of a   into potential violations of sex trafficking laws that involves an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz turned immediately to the airwaves Tuesday to refute the allegations of a relationship with a minor, doing so in a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson, who afterward called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."" ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Carlson. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Reports of the investigation into Gaetz, first published by the New York Times, have brought fresh   to the controversial young congressman. Elected to Congress in 2016 after serving in the Florida State Legislature, Gaetz is the scion of a powerful political family in his home state. His father Don served as president of the Florida Senate and has a reported net worth of more than $25 million, according to Florida financial disclosure reports. A frequent guest at   Mar-a-Lago resort, Gaetz, 38, emerged as a fierce defender of the former president who vocally backed Trump through two impeachment trials and repeated Trump's baseless claims of a stolen election in the midst of the attack on the Capitol, even taking to the House floor and falsely suggesting that antifa protesters were behind the riot. ""They were masquerading as Trump supporters,"" Gaetz said. The Florida congressman even traveled to Wyoming to headline a campaign rally targeting fellow Republican Liz Cheney after the congresswoman voted for the former president's second impeachment. Earlier, during Trump's first impeachment trial, Gaetz defended Trump by issuing a menacing tweet targeting Trump's former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and his wife before Cohen testified before Congress. ""Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot,"" Gaetz tweeted, which prompted the Florida Bar to open an investigation into the congressman's comments. Trump, in turn, has lavished praise over Gaetz at his boisterous rallies, calling him a ""great talent, young, handsome"" and saying that he's ""going places."" Trump also noted at a 2018 rally in Fort Myers, Florida, ""You talk about defending, he's fantastic."" So far, key figures in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr. and the former president himself, have yet to weigh in on the allegations against Gaetz. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial figure herself, defended Gaetz on Twitter Wednesday, calling the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and adding, ""I stand with @mattgaetz."" Gaetz has broken from his party on occasion. In 2019, Gaetz was one of the few members to come to the defense of Democratic Rep. Katie Hill after the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into allegations that Hill had an extramarital affair with an office staffer. ""This is just absurd. The only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill's soon-to-be ex,"" Gaetz tweeted, adding, ""Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?"" However, other interactions Gaetz has had with congresswomen have ignited controversy, including repeatedly commenting on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's appearance. Gaetz has called Ocasio-Cortez ""attractive"" multiple times, and in an interview with TMZ, he referenced the dating app Tinder by saying he would ""swipe right"" on the idea of working with her on cannabis legislation. In a Daily Caller segment from 2019 that centered around Gaetz's opinions regarding Ocasio-Cortez, the Florida congressman again commented on her looks, referring to his colleague as an ""attractive lady from Queens."" Later in 2020, when Gaetz revealed for the first time that he had raised a young man from Cuba as his son, the now-former Rep. Hill returned the favor and defended him publicly amid a surge of questions. ""Many of you know @mattgaetz & I have an unlikely friendship,"" Hill tweeted. ""I can't stand a lot of his beliefs but he's been there for me when others haven't. He talks about Nestor more than anything, has done so much for his son & is truly a proud dad."" Gaetz has repeatedly referred to 19-year-old Nestor Galban, the brother of one of Gaetz's ex-girlfriends, as his son -- but has suggested that he never formally adopted him. ""Our relationship as a family is defined by our love for each other, not by any paperwork,"" he told People magazine. Later on an episode of his podcast, Gaetz said he feels ""like a single step-parent at times,"" adding, ""There's a certain kind of love that you can give to another human being, you know, that is not your own flesh and blood, that's not your own kid."" Galban was in the background during Gaetz's 2017 Facebook live stream when he defended his no vote on the anti-human-trafficking bill. ""As you guys can see, I've got my, my helper Nestor over here. I'm in my parents' house out in Walton County,"" Gaetz said."

Up until the last few weeks,   only Americans with the highest   from the virus and the biggest incentive to protect themselves, were eligible. But by late April, as vaccine supply ramps up, all adults -- not just those with the most reason to fear the virus --   and get their shot. So, will they? ""This is when the real work begins,"" said Dr. Timothy Callaghan, a   politics professor at Texas A&M University who studies vaccine hesitancy. Callaghan said public health experts have been   particular fight for months, even before earlier vaccine issues were smoothed over. ""We weren't worried about the supply issues that we were seeing early in the vaccine delivery process,"" Callaghan said. ""We were concerned about what was going to start to happen from April through July, as states start to realize we have the vaccines, but don't have people to take them."" Now, on the heels of President Joe Biden's announcement that   to all adults by April 19, the time has come. The U.S. is administering nearly 3 million shots per day and, by May, drugmakers are expected to deliver enough vaccines to vaccinate 300 million Americans. Meanwhile, about six in 10 Americans reported already getting a vaccine or intending to get one -- a number that has increased -- with 17% who said they're taking a ""wait and see"" approach, according to March polling from the  . Remaining about the same since December are the 13% who said they will ""definitely not"" get the vaccine. With the floodgates open to mass vaccination, the spring and summer months should provide a clearer view of how much work needs to be done to vaccinate as many Americans as possible, Callaghan said. Among the first states to widen eligibility were Alaska, Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia, Ohio and Utah. As of Thursday, 19 states total had opened their eligibility to all adults 16 and older, and another 27 states plus Washington, D.C., had announced plans to do so. Some rural and Republican states have already seen signs of early hesitancy that allowed them, in part, to open their vaccination rollout up to the broader population earlier than any other states. Polling has shown people living in red, rural states report more vaccine hesitancy. In Ohio, the governor said they've seen less interest in vaccine registration as they open it up to younger populations. ""We seem to be having a slower uptake every time we move down in age,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said at a press briefing just before the state opened eligibility to all adults on March 29. ""But, I mean, the interesting thing is even in the older groups, you continue still to see those numbers go up,"" he said, noting that the number of vaccinated people in their 80s is continuing to rise. DeWine openly acknowledged that he was concerned about vaccine hesitancy getting in the way of herd immunity for the state, though. ""Frankly, a lot is gonna depend on our young people's willingness to take this vaccine and to slow the spread down,"" DeWine said. And in West Virginia, the state's   response coordinator, Clay Marsh, said they were surprised that as many people are getting vaccinated as they are. The state widely opened eligibility on March 22. ""We did anticipate having a lot more vaccine hesitancy,"" Marsh said, noting that people from rural and Republican areas of the country are more hesitant than those from urban and Democrat areas. ""Well, we're pretty rural and we're pretty Republican,"" Marsh continued. And while they've seen pockets of hesitancy, Marsh said, the state has been pleased that 70% of people in the 65+ age group have gotten vaccines. In December, state data showed that around 45% of the state was either less willing or strongly unwilling to get a vaccine. In Mississippi, one local doctor suggested people are waiting for the vaccine to appear at their physician's office before they get the shot. The state opened up eligibility to all adults two weeks ago and continues to have thousands of open appointments. ""It's not so much hesitancy as it is access for most of our patients,"" said Dr. Laura Miller, a family physician who mostly treats patients from rural, minority communities in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi. Because   of all the vaccines in Mississippi have been offered at drive-thru mass vaccination clinics and other state-run sites, Miller sees a lot of patients who want to or need to wait until they can get the vaccine closer to home, in a more familiar setting. ""I have patients here that want to get their shot, they just don't have a means to get there or don't want to until I can do it,"" Miller said. There's also ""some hesitancy, and there's some straight refusal,"" she added. Still, Miller predicted that when there's enough vaccine supply to get doses out to individual clinics and pharmacies, ""we'll have some fairly steady uptake."" On Monday, Biden said that by April 19, 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Taken all together, even among states that share population demographics and politics, there's still not a sole factor that can predict vaccine hesitancy. Jeff Zients, Biden's coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a briefing last week that he wasn't concerned about states that were opening their eligibility up to all adults well in advance of the May 1 deadline. ""If there are states that are lagging behind, we're working with those states to ensure that they continue to prioritize the most vulnerable populations. That said, with the increase in demand, we think it's a good thing that states are opening up eligibility to all Americans no later than May 1st,"" Zients said Friday. But while there will be people who want the vaccine and people who don't, states will also have to do more than just open up eligibility to achieve herd immunity. They will have to improve systems making it harder for people to get the vaccine, compounding hesitancy that already exists. Long drives to unfamiliar towns or cities where vaccines are being distributed, clunky registration websites, long hold times on the phone and lack of outreach can all give the impression of ""vaccine hesitancy,"" when in reality, community members are willing to get the vaccine but face logistical hurdles, which are often worse in poorer communities. Experts have also warned that opening up eligibility widely could allow people with easier access to transportation and technology to leap over less advantaged people for appointments. ""That is a potential red flag and something to be aware of,"" Callaghan said. ""To try and work against that, states need to be paying attention to populations they are vaccinating on a daily and weekly basis to say 'okay, we're not getting enough people from this at-risk community or that at-risk community, so maybe we need to set aside some appointments for those groups to make sure that they are still getting vaccinated.'"" There will also be unpredictable benefits to widely opening up eligibility, like the power of peer pressure. As more people get the vaccine, they'll share how they got it and what it felt like with their friends and family, increasing trust in the shot. But for the next several weeks, the effect will be unknown. ""You can't really say that hesitancy is the cause until you've given people a chance to vaccinate and then they choose not to,"" Callaghan said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/army-awards-microsoft-22-billion-contract-futuristic-goggles/story?id=76798519,politics,"The Army has awarded   a contract that could be worth almost $22 billion for   that give soldiers a new way to see the battlefield. Known as IVAS, the acronym for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, the goggles project 3D terrain maps over what soldiers see directly in front of them and allows troops to see in the dark, through smoke and even around corners. Based on Microsoft's HoloLens 2, the augmented reality goggles were ruggedized for the wear and tear of combat and have undergone prototype testing over the past two years. On Wednesday, the Army announced that it had awarded a 10-year production contract to Microsoft for the IVAS system potentially worth $21.88 billion. The contract has a five-year base period followed by another five-year option, said Courtney Bacon, an Army spokesperson. Microsoft said that the contract could provide more than 120,000 goggles to the Close Combat Force. ""We appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Army, and are thankful for their continued trust in transitioning IVAS from rapid prototyping to rapid fielding,"" wrote Microsoft's Alex Kipman in a   post. Kipman designed Holo Lens and has led the research and development of the goggle's conversion into IVAS for the Army. Last fall, Kipman told ABC News that the goggle system provides soldiers with a significant upgrade in situational awareness. The system gives soldiers more information than they have ever had on the battlefield. ""The IVAS aggregates multiple technologies into an architecture that allows the Soldier to Fight, Rehearse, and Train using a single platform,"" said an Army statement   the production contract. Attached to combat helmets, the clear goggles allow soldiers to know precisely where they are thanks to a heads-up display, or HUD, that provides them with an overhead compass and overlays maps of their location. Holograms and 3D terrain maps are projected onto the goggles to see what lies ahead and lets soldiers know precisely where their squad mates are on the battlefield. The goggles also incorporate significant improvements in night vision and thermal imagery technologies that give soldiers a full 180-degree field of view. An attachment mounted on a rifle barrel projects onto the HUD whatever could be seen through the rifle scope, regardless of what direction a soldier is looking. That capability gives troops an edge in dangerous urban warfare by letting them peer around corners. The high-tech goggles will be made available to all of the Army's combat infantry troops, bringing them resources that may have once been only available to elite units. Eric Oehlerich, a retired Navy SEAL and ABC News contributor, sees that as a step toward improving the combat effectiveness of all American troops on the battlefield. ""The more situational awareness you have about your forces, and the enemy position, the easier it is to dominate the fight,"" he added. ""Investments in equipment like the IVAS goggles will greatly increase the awareness each service member will have during the 'fog of war,' making them more lethal when called upon."" Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine and ABC News contributor, agreed with Oehlerich, but also stressed that basic military skills will need to be maintained. ""It is also important that we don't become over reliant on technology,"" said Mulroy. ""We need to train with it and without it, as our adversaries will no doubt try and counter our technological improvements."" The deal is the second major contract won by the tech giant in recent years. Last year, the Pentagon selected Microsoft over Amazon to take over its $10 billion JEDI cloud project. While the IVAS contract is twice as large as the JEDI project, it could end up being less if the Army decides not to pursue its five-year option."

Moser has been one of the hottest mid-major coaches in the country since leading Loyola Chicago to the Final Four in 2018. Since then, he has led the Ramblers to at least a share of two Missouri Valley Conference regular-season championships. They went 26-5 this season, beating           and 1-seed           en route to a Sweet 16 appearance. ""I've always said there are reasons why you win. If you look at the standards that the programs at Oklahoma have set, there are reasons why they've won,"" Moser said in a statement. ""The coaches, infrastructure and community are all championship caliber. You just want to be a part of that. To play in a premiere league like the Big 12 and be a part of this championship culture excites me."" A Naperville, Illinois, native, Moser hasn't jumped at high-major coaching opportunities over the past couple of seasons.           pursued him after Chris Mullin stepped down, but Moser returned to Loyola. He was linked to various openings this spring but appeared likely to head back to the Ramblers until Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger retired late last month. Castiglione quickly zeroed in on Moser, and he had been the clear leader for the job the past couple of days. ""We are absolutely thrilled to announce and welcome Porter Moser as our next great OU head coach,"" Castiglione said in a statement. ""As we dug deep into the backgrounds of candidates, his attributes, acumen and record of success totally aligned with what we were seeking."" Oklahoma will introduce Moser at a news conference next week. Moser began his coaching career in 1990 as an assistant coach at          , his alma mater. He also spent time as an assistant coach at          ,          ,           and          . Moser was also a head coach at Arkansas-Little Rock and          . ""It is impossible to properly thank Porter for all he's done for our basketball program and University,"" Loyola Chicago athletic director Steve Watson said in a statement. ""His vision and leadership brought Loyola to new heights and Ramblers everywhere will be eternally grateful. A huge thank you and best wishes, from all Ramblers, are rightfully being extended to Porter and his family as they embark on their next journey."" Kruger retired after 45 years in coaching. He had been at Oklahoma for the past decade, leading the Sooners to seven NCAA tournaments and a Final Four appearance in 2016."
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/stanford-coach-tara-vanderveer-questioned-cardinal-continue-weeks/story?id=76854923,sports,"SAN ANTONIO --           coach Tara VanDerveer has her team playing for a national championship on Sunday against Arizona. But she admitted for the first time Saturday she wondered how the Cardinal would even get to this point after enhanced COVID-19 guidelines in Santa Clara County forced them on the road for nine weeks. The odyssey started in early December and lasted through early February, taking them through six states and a temporary ""home"" in Santa Cruz before they were given clearance to return home to Stanford to play out the regular season. ""There was a point where -- I don't even know that I should admit this -- but I was like, I don't know that we can keep doing this, in terms of going to Santa Cruz,"" VanDerveer said on a Zoom call with reporters. ""Testing like we were testing. There were some days where I just said, 'Whoa, this, might be too much. We might have to just take a pause, ourselves. ""But we have great leadership. We have, competitive motivated, talented, really strong women on our team, and they have dug deep. I think that off the court experience has made us tougher, stronger and more determined. We're not going to let COVID get us down, whether it's testing or Zooming. We're going to be the best Stanford basketball team we can be, and I'm proud of our team for that."" There was nothing perfect about the scenario. Stanford forward Cameron Brink detailed a few times where the power went out at a gym they managed to practice in. ""We were practicing in the dark,"" she said. ""It was freezing in that gym, but we're thankful we had a gym to practice. It made us tougher. We had some really hard practices in that gym, and I feel like those practices are a big reason why we're here today."" She also attributes the bubble Stanford created for itself during its extended road trip has helped the Cardinal manage the bubble they have been in during the NCAA tournament in San Antonio. ""I feel like it's kind of an advantage for us,"" Brink said. ""When we were on the road for almost two months straight, other teams were kind of at home and when they came to the bubble in San Antonio, they didn't really know what to expect, and we kind of knew like what being stuck in hotels like for weeks on end, so I think we're lucky to have experienced that."" Beyond the bubble experience, there also is familiarity with the opponent Sunday:          , a team the Cardinal beat twice this season. This is the first all-Pac-12 championship basketball game matchup in history -- both men's and women's. Stanford is trying to win its first title in 29 years, while Arizona is playing for the first national championship in school history. No matter who wins, it would be the first Pac-12 women's basketball championship since Stanford last won it in 1992. ""This is honestly a dream come true for us in the Pac-12 because for so long, the conference has not gotten the respect that I feel it deserves,"" VanDerveer said. Arizona coach Adia Barnes agreed. ""For me to constantly see the Pac-12 have no respect, it's continuously and it's always happening,"" Barnes said. ""So now I'm hoping that with both of us in the championship game, that the Pac-12 will get more respect, and the East Coast bias will stop. It's not going to stop overnight, but I think that you need to respect the Pac-12 a lot more."""

""Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,"" Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft."" Manfred said the new host city and details about events will be announced ""shortly."" At a press conference on Saturday, Gov. Brian Kemp slammed MLB's decision, saying, ""I will not be backing down from this fight."" ""MLB caved to fear and lies from liberal activists,"" Kemp said. ""They ignored the facts of our new election integrity law and they ignored the consequences of their decision on our community."" Kemp blamed Democrats, including President Joe Biden and former Georgia Rep. Stacey Abrams, for MLB's decision. ""Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams, Joe Biden and the left, but I am not and we are not,"" said Kemp, echoing his sentiments made in a statement issued Friday that MLB's ""knee-jerk reaction"" was because ""cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included."" The Atlanta Braves said in a statement that the team was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision and that ""this was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to have the discussion."" The new law, passed by the Georgia House and Senate and signed by Kemp on March 25, has   due to several limits it puts on voting in the state. The bill passed along party lines, with Republicans vocally supporting it and Democrats calling it voter suppression. Republicans contend it will streamline elections and increase confidence in the process following outrage from Republicans and former President Donald Trump over his defeat in the presidential election and Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock winning runoff elections in January. Critics see it differently, contending it's meant to suppress the votes of historically disenfranchised communities, namely Black voters. The chief executives of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola   on Wednesday, a change from prior public stances. After the bill passed, Delta's CEO praised aspects of it while a Coca-Cola executive said the corporation was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Neither corporation publicly opposed the bill before it was signed into law despite mounting pressure from a coalition of voting rights and civil liberties groups. Biden has condemned the new law in and voiced support for moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta in  . ""I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly,"" Biden said. ""I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them. They're leaders."" Ossoff has said he disagreed with Biden over moving the game, and  Warnock issued a statement calling MLB's decision an ""unfortunate consequence"" resulting from ""politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians' voices."" ""It is my hope,"" Warnock added, ""that businesses, athletes and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on, and hand-in-hand with the community."" Abrams, who's led the charge for increased access to voting in Georgia,   on Wednesday asking for companies not to boycott the state. ""I understand the passion of those calling for boycotts of Georgia following the passage of SB 202,"" she said in the video. ""Boycotts have been an important tool throughout our history to achieve social change.

They prioritized making it harder for people of color to vote over the economic well-being of all Georgians,"" Abrams said in a statement following the announcement of the All-Star Game leaving Atlanta. ""Like many Georgians, I am disappointed that the MLB is relocating the All-Star game; however, I commend the players, owners and League commissioner for speaking out."" MLB reiterated its support for voting access in its statement and called attention to the voter initiatives it undertook last season. ""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" Manfred's statement continued. ""In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States."" ""We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process,"" Manfred continued. ""Fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support."" Freddie Freeman, the Braves' top player and the National League MVP in 2020, said Thursday before the team's season opener that he'd prefer the league kept the game in Atlanta and used it as a way to call attention to the law and the importance of access to voting. ""I think it'd be better to keep it and use a platform,"" Freeman told reporters. ""What's happened in the last couple of months has already gone through, so why not use what we already have here as a platform in the city and state that it has been passed through?"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat who called the elections bill both ""ridiculous"" and ""unnecessary,"" predicted more fallout. ""Just as elections have consequences, so do the actions of those who are elected. Unfortunately, the removal of the @MLB All Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall, until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,"" she  . On the same day MLB pulled this year's All-Star Game out of Atlanta, Milwaukee made a pitch to host the game, with Mayor Tom Barrett writing a letter to Manfred that read, in part: ""As you review alternative sites for the game, I ask you to consider Milwaukee. It is a particularly appropriate location to honor Hank Aaron who is a revered and beloved former Milwaukeean. He started and concluded his Major League career with teams here."" The All-Star Game was last held in Milwaukee in 2002 at what was then known as Miller Park. ""We are finalizing a new host city,"" Manfred said in his statement, ""and details about these events will be announced shortly."""

When the former league MVP returns, the Nets will be tasked with quickly building chemistry on the fly before the playoffs begin in mid-May. Nash feels the friendships the group has built off the court should aid the players in meshing well on the floor. Still, Nash said the entire roster needs to play some games together so the Nets can iron out a rotation and jell before the postseason begins. Nash said he also felt the team needed to play through challenging games, some close games, together and ""face some adversity,"" so that they have some familiarity before they find themselves facing that in a playoff game.

Embracing a bigger role in Charlotte than he had in Boston, Hayward has excelled for the Hornets this season, averaging 19.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game while shooting 41.5% from 3-point range. The Hornets -- already without star rookie          , who is out indefinitely with a fractured wrist -- have been one of the league's biggest surprises this season. Heading into Sunday's game in Boston, Charlotte sits two games over .500 and in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. The Hornets enter Saturday night's action projected by ESPN's Basketball Power Index to finish sixth in the East, which would allow them to avoid the play-in tournament and make the playoffs for the first time since losing in seven games to the           in the first round of the 2016 playoffs. Since returning to the league as an expansion team for the 2004-05 season, Charlotte has made the playoffs only three times and has yet to advance out of the first round. The Hornets are 1-3 in the four games Hayward has missed this season (24-20 with him), allowing 9.5 points per game more than when Hayward plays, according to ESPN Stats & Information data."

The Lakers are without           and           due to injuries. And Lue did not think that point guard           (knee) would be able to return and join Rondo on the floor. Beverley has missed the past 11 games due to injury. Starting center           also has been out for the past 10 games with a back injury. Rondo won a championship last season with the Lakers and will now take part in the Los Angeles rivalry on the other side with the Clippers. ""It's different,"" Rondo said of playing for the Clippers in the rivalry recently in an interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols. ""It is a rivalry here in Los Angeles. But for the most part, I have been getting a bunch of 'welcome back's. It is different coming back to LA being a champion."" Hampered by an adductor injury, Rondo has been consistently working to learn the Clippers' playbook while he rested. ""Just kind of plugging him in, just seeing what he picks up,"" Lue said of what he hopes to see from Rondo. ""It's easy to go through plays in practice, but then you got a game on the fly, it is a little different. And I know how smart he is. Just seeing what he picks up and just seeing what we can incorporate while he is in the game and just try to go from there. It is going to be good to see him get on the floor."""

""I just wanted to prove everyone wrong,"" he            Saturday. ""As time went on baseball became more of a business and less of a game. I couldn't help but notice my love and passion for this game started to diminish. I always thought baseball was a cool job. I also knew that same job paid extremely well. What young kid doesn't want a cool job that pays well?"" The right-hander was one of the key pieces of the Angels' bullpen over the past three seasons, but he struggled with control problems during spring training and was optioned to the team's alternate training site. His 115 appearances from 2018-20 were fourth on the team among pitchers, and he was 8-11 with a 4.30 ERA. Buttrey, 28, said he informed the Angels of his decision to leave baseball, and the organization asked him to take some more time to think about it. He did not outline his next steps in his statement. Angels manager Joe Maddon said before Friday's game against the           that he had not been in contact with Buttrey since last weekend, but that he did see the statement. ""I could hear his voice as I'm reading it. He's a very thoughtful young man, and I understood precisely what he's talking about,"" Maddon said. ""If the fun is diminished, don't do it. I totally agree with that. I think as youth, we've all gone through those moments about choosing things that follow your heart, as opposed to not. And so a lot of respect to what he said. ""I'm wishing nothing but the best. I'm looking forward to staying in touch with him and being of help in any way I can.''"
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jamel-herring-dominates-carl-frampton-announces-retirement/story?id=76858984,sports,"Jamel Herring sent Carl Frampton into retirement with a sixth-round TKO in a third defense of his WBO world junior lightweight title Saturday. Herring fought to a career-best win as he thwarted Frampton's attempt to become the first boxer from Ireland to win world titles in three weight divisions. Afterward, an emotional Frampton announced his retirement. Herring, 35, shrugged off a nasty cut on his right eyelid to produce a polished performance as he controlled the distance against his shorter opponent, who was stopped after hitting the canvas in the fifth and sixth rounds. Herring (23-2, 11 KOs) celebrated his achievement without the presence of fans because of coronavirus restrictions at Caesars Palace Dubai in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. A 2012 Olympian originally from Long Island, New York, but now based in Cincinnati, Herring deserved to hear cheers for his achievement, the latest chapter of a late-blossoming career. Afterward, he said he hoped to unify belts against Mexico's Oscar Valdez, the WBC champion and ESPN's No. 1-ranked fighter in the division. ""I want to get another title,"" Herring said. ""I know Oscar Valdez has expressed interest in unifying. Most people know I have plans in moving up [in weight], but if that fight is available, let's do it."" But while Herring looks forward to bigger fights, Frampton (28-3, 16 KOs) is hanging up the gloves after a third professional defeat in a division with opponents who are too big for him. Frampton, 34, finishes after winning world titles at junior featherweight and featherweight, which is enough for some to consider him the best boxer in Irish history, regardless of whether he became a three-weight world champion against Herring. ""I'm deeply upset,"" said Frampton, who said he wanted to dedicate the fight to his old amateur coach, Billy McKee, who died recently. ""I said before the fight I would retire if I lost this fight and that's exactly what I will do. ... I want to dedicate my life to my family now. Boxing has been good to me. It has also been bad to me. The last few years have been the best of my career."" If there were any doubts around Frampton's quest to make history, they were based on Herring's physical advantages. They turned out to be valid concerns as Frampton failed to impose himself against the biggest opponent of his career. Herring is 5 inches taller than Frampton and has a 7-inch reach advantage. ""I lost to the better man,"" Frampton said. ""I really struggled to get inside him. ... It's zero excuses. I had an amazing camp."" Frampton questioned how well Herring made weight for their fight, but the American looked a lot sharper than he did in his previous outing against Jonathan Oquendo in September, when Herring won after Oquendo was disqualified because of an illegal head-butt. ""It was an emotional roller coaster just to get here,"" Herring said. ""My last outing wasn't the best. People called me every name in the book, people doubted me but even with the cut I wasn't going to quit."" In the opening round Saturday, Herring contained Frampton behind his long jab and also landed a good left. In the second round, Herring continued to dictate the fight as Frampton struggled to get inside the American's jab. Frampton was knocked back on his heels by a straight left early in the third as Herring controlled the early rounds by controlling the distance. Frampton was better when the fight was fought at close range, as it was in the fourth, and he unloaded hooks with Herring against the ropes. The attack opened a cut by Herring's right eye for the second successive fight, and he finished the round with blood streaming down his face. Frampton had never fought anyone as big as Herring and by the fifth round he was looking more confident. But Frampton was stopped suddenly in his tracks after walking on to a left hand and was deposited on his backside for a count. Frampton looked vulnerable for a while, but Herring did not capitalize until the sixth round, when he nailed his challenger with a left uppercut for another count. Herring went for the finish with more than a minute left in the round and threw a series of hooks that left Frampton on shaky legs, prompting his corner to throw in the towel and the fight to be stopped. ""It's tough to see any champion of the sport go out like that,"" Herring said. ""I'm honored to share the ring with him."" Herring later took to Twitter to salute Frampton. Herring trained alongside ESPN's pound-for-pound No. 1 Terence Crawford ahead of this fight. A former U.S. Marine, Herring made his first trip to the Middle East since he was on the second of two tours to Iraq."

Among the six who entered the transfer portal during a week in March were four members of the 2020 freshman class. Brennan's attorney, Tom Mars, told ESPN in a statement that Cincinnati is mishandling its investigation. ""It's been my experience that collegiate ADs are experts at mishandling internal investigations, and this case is no exception,"" Mars said. ""You don't have to take my word for it. I'm in possession of a communication from within the UC Athletics Department describing the mishandling of this internal investigation in much more descriptive terms. ""There's no basis for Coach Brannen to have been placed on administrative leave -- much less terminated for cause."" Mars added that Brannen would deserve his $5.25 million buyout if athletic director John Cunningham decides to fire him, threatening a lawsuit if the school tries to fire Brannen with cause.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/traffic-jam-eases-suez-canal-ship-unblocked-76832227,business,"CAIRO -- The maritime traffic jam on both ends of the Suez Canal eased further on Friday, four days after the dislodging of a massive containership that had blocked the waterway, authorities said. On Monday, salvage teams freed the skyscraper-sized Ever Given, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the world’s most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce. At the time, canal officials said that more than 420 ships had been waiting for the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship to be freed so they could make the crossing. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, head of the Suez Canal Authority said 80 cargo ships carrying carrying a total load of 4.7 tons transited through the canal on Friday, including the American aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. “This proves the global maritime community has great faith in the Suez Canal and Egypt's ability to guarantee safety and security to different types of vessels,” Rabie was quoted in a statement. Earlier, Leth Agencies said that a total of 357 vessels have crossed the Canal since the ship was re-floated by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides. The number of vessels waiting to transit fell to 206 on Friday, the company said, from over 300 earlier in the week. The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. Others waited in place for the blockage to be over. The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to strain on the shipping industry, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic."

""But we’re happy to have a conversation with people, less about the price tag, more about what are the elements that should be in the plan that people think are missing.” Those conversations could be limited to Democrats as McConnell declared: “I’m going to fight them every step of the way."" Biden told his Cabinet at its first meeting that he is enlisting several of them to help with the push: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Working with my team here at the White House, each Cabinet member will represent me in dealings with Congress, engage the public in selling the plan and help organize the details as we refine it and move forward,"" Biden said. The task will involve lots of salesmanship for a legacy-making piece of legislation that Biden announced in a Wednesday speech. “Changes in my plan are certain,” Biden acknowledged on Friday, “but inaction is not an option.” His administration must sway Congress. It needs to rally voters. It’s also looking to outside economists to back the plan. It’s monitoring Wall Street for any celebrations or jitters. It’s forming alliances with advocates, while dealing with critics of the plan's corporate tax hikes and project details. And Biden's administration also intends, per the plan, to cajole other nations to stop slashing their own tax rates in what has been a race-to-the-bottom to attract and retain multinational businesses. Biden's vehicle for financing his infrastructure plans is a key dividing line. Republicans object to raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, one of the many changes so that business   would fund infrastructure. Republicans had cut the corporate rate from 35% in 2017, a hallmark policy achievement of  's presidency. Within Washington and corporate board rooms, the administration is attracting its share of accolades and rebukes on his proposal. In Biden's own party, liberal Democrats in Congress want him to go bigger. And Democrats representing high-tax states want to remove a 2017 tax code change that limited deductions of state and local taxes for individuals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed no qualms about the proposal's scope. “It was in the tradition of America -- to think big,” Pelosi said at a press conference Thursday. “And now, in this century, President Biden is undertaking something in the tradition of thinking big, being transformational and creating jobs for America.” While many leading business groups oppose the higher taxes, some major companies see reason for optimism because of the innovations that would be encouraged by the plan. Automakers Ford, General Motors and Toyota endorsed the general concepts of Biden’s plan, which calls for the construction of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 in what would be a shift away from gasoline-powered cars. But some environmentalists said the plan's shift away from fossil fuels that cause climate change was not substantial enough. “Biden has pledged to cut carbon emissions 50% and decarbonize our electricity sector, but this proposal won’t even come close,"" said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The White House was quick to address the climate change concerns. Climate adviser Gina McCarthy said the administration expects the infrastructure package to include Biden’s pledge to set a national standard requiring utilities to produce 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The proposed electricity standard “is going to be fairly robust, and it’s going to be inclusive,’’ McCarthy said. “I think we can get to the results that we’re looking for in a number of different ways. If a clean energy standard can be done, we think it should be done.’’ For every criticism of the plan's details, there were also plaudits for its broader approach. Harvard University economist Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary, endorsed Biden's plan, after previously criticizing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan because of its size and debt-based financing. He downplayed any risks from corporate tax hikes, since low interest rates mean the costs of obtaining capital are already low for many companies. “I am excited,” Summers said on Twitter. “The economy's capacity will go up.” The plan also carries a political dimension as organized labor is mobilizing to get the package passed, an important push given the steady, recent Republican gains among working class voters. Biden's plan, with its focus on construction and manufacturing jobs, has the potential to reverse some of that slide — and the unions that backed him in 2020 are promising to help deliver votes on infrastructure. “Our members are an army a half-million strong, that will make calls, visit members of Congress and rally for good jobs building our nation’s infrastructure,"" said Terry O’Sullivan, general president of Laborers International Union of North America, one of the largest construction trades unions. ""We did it with boots on the ground to get President Biden elected.” ——— AP reporters Darlene Superville, Zeke Miller, Matthew Daly and Tom Krisher contributed to this report."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-higher-sp-500-tops-4000-points-76830202,business,"NEW YORK -- Stocks rose in many of the markets worldwide that were open on Good Friday, while Treasury yields rallied after a report showed U.S. employers added hundreds of thousands more jobs last month than economists expected. The U.S. bond market closed early after an holiday-shortened session that saw the yield on the 10-year Treasury climb to 1.72% from 1.68% late Thursday. It's been rising sharply this year on expectations that a supercharged economic recovery and higher inflation are on the way due to COVID-19 vaccinations and massive spending by the U.S. government. The yield began the year close to 0.90%. In Asia, stocks in Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai all rose a day after the S&P 500 passed the 4,000-point level for the first time. Many major  s were closed in observance of Good Friday, including in New York and much of Europe. Futures for U.S. stock indexes rose, suggesting the S&P 500 may add to its record when trading resumes on Monday. Friday morning's U.S. jobs report was highly anticipated, and investors hoped it would show their expectations for a strong economic recovery were warranted. Hiring blew past expectations, with employers adding 916,000 more jobs than they cut last month. Economists had forecast growth of 617,500. It was nearly double the jobs growth from February, and it was the strongest since August. The data helped S&P 500 futures climb 0.4%, following the 1.2% rise for the index on Thursday to an all-time high. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 also climbed. “This is about as clear as it gets, the reopening is happening faster than nearly anyone expected,” Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said in a statement. He also pointed to how the U.S. government said hiring in January and February was stronger than earlier estimated. The numbers reassured investors that a sustained recovery appears to be taking root as more people get vaccinated and businesses reopen. So too did a corner of the jobs report showing workers' wages aren't jumping yet, even as hiring accelerates. Average hourly earnings dipped 0.1% in March from a month earlier, on a seasonally adjusted basis. While that's frustrating for workers, it encourages investors who had worried that a burst of inflation may be on the way. If inflation were to shoot higher and remain there, it would likely send Treasury yields spiking even higher. Higher interest rates make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks, particularly those seen as the most expensive. They also hurt stocks of companies asking investors to wait many years for big profit growth to come to fruition. Such worries have hurt the momentum for big technology stocks in particular this year. Helping to counterbalance such concerns in the   this year has been immense spending by the U.S. government, which investors expect to help boost corporate profits. President Joe Biden unveiled details of his latest push earlier this week, a $2.3 trillion plan to shore up the nation's infrastructure. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.6% to 29,854.00 on Friday. The Kospi in South Korea added 0.8% to 3,112.80, and stocks in Shanghai picked up 0.5% to 3,484.39. —— AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/biden-aims-juice-ev-sales-plan-work-76827906,business,"DETROIT -- Dangling tax credits and rebates in his drive to fight climate change, President   wants you to trade your gas-burning car, truck or SUV for a zero-emissions electric vehicle. Some buyers would find his offer persuasive. Yet Biden's goal is a daunting one: Even if Congress approves his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, along with its incentives, it would take many years to replace enough internal combustion vehicles with EVs to make a huge dent in tailpipe emissions. Right now, there are about 279 million vehicles on the road in the United States. The proportion that are fully electric, according to IHS Markit, is 0.36%. Of the 14.5 million new vehicles that were sold last year, 2% were fully electric. Even if every new vehicle sold were battery powered — something no one envisions — it would take about 15 years to swap out the entire fleet. What's more, cars built during the past two decades last far longer than previous vehicles, so buyers are keeping them longer. The average U.S. vehicle has been on the road for nearly 12 years. Research shows that each EV sold does cut emissions. But it could take a couple of years for an EV to reach that point if coal is used to generate power to recharge the vehicle, said Bruce Belzowski, a retired University of Michigan transportation researcher who runs a company that studies the auto industry's future. “If you don't start somewhere, you're never going to get anywhere,” Belzowski said. “Every electric vehicle that you sell is going to be net positive for the environment.” The Biden administration didn't offer specifics on just how much car buyers would receive to trade in their vehicles. But it plans to spend $174 billion over eight years on EVs. That figure includes incentives for consumers, grants to build 500,000 charging stations, and money to develop U.S. supply chains for parts and minerals needed to make batteries. “We're going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to all American families,” Biden said Wednesday. The biggest incentive likely will be expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit, now $7,500, which is phased out after an automaker sells 200,000 battery-electric vehicles. Tesla and General Motors have exceeded the cap. Nissan is getting close. A summary of Biden's plan didn't have any numbers. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, though, are backing a bill that would raise the cap to 600,000. The bill also includes a tax credit of at least $1,250 for those who buy used EVs. Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, an industry consulting firm, said that either the administration doesn't yet have specific numbers or deliberately omitted them while negotiations take place among the auto industry, Congress and environmental groups. “They know there's going to be some level of compromise needed,” he said. The form and size of the rebates also were not detailed. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has proposed large discounts to those who buy American-made EVs — a possible reprise of the 2009 “Cash for Clunkers” program that offered $4,500 rebates for people to trade in less-efficient vehicles. The rebates and charging stations address two key reasons why many consumers are wary about switching to electric vehicles, Schuster said. Combined, he predicts that the incentives would help elevate EV sales from about 358,000 this year to over 1 million by 2023 and up to 4 million by 2030. If Biden's plan succeeds and EV sales take off, shortages of computer chips, metals used to build batteries, and a lack of battery factory capacity could leave the industry falling behind buyer demand, at least for a couple of years, Schuster said. David Kirsch, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, said the Biden plan isn't really a tipping point that will turn consumers from combustion to electric vehicles. “There will be some good changes that will happen because of the scale of this investment, and those should not be minimized,"" Kirsch said. “I think electrification was coming anyway.” Indeed, the industry already was spending billions to develop EVs. LMC Automotive said 22 new electric models are coming out this year. A 2018 study by Alix Partners found that the global auto industry would spend $255 billion on EVs by 2023. At the same time, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota and most major automakers, wrote in a letter to Biden that despite battery costs declining, EVs still are more expensive than combustion vehicles. The group, joined by the United Auto Workers union and a parts supply association, is urging the government to help address the difference. It is seeking tax credits, research spending and requirements to replace the federal fleet with electric vehicles. Even with such added spending, people in general will likely drive less in the future, because in the aftermath of the pandemic, many companies will allow a combination of work from home and office work. That will make some people even more reluctant to replace their vehicles, Schuster said. Yet Kirsch says that no matter how effective Biden's plan is or isn't in fighting climate change, the spending on modernizing the transportation fleet and infrastructure is long overdue. “What we're doing is playing catch-up on some long-delayed investment,” he said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-photos-spains-seville-settles-subdued-easter-week-76850504,business,"SEVILLE, Spain -- Few Roman Catholics in devout southern   would have ever imagined an April without the pomp and ceremony of Holy Week processions. With the   pandemic unremitting, they will miss them for a second year. The streets of Seville and other Spanish cities again went without Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday celebrations marking the life, death and resurrection of Christ. The infection rate for COVID-19 is still too high for groups to be allowed to gather. For 50-year-old Roberto Ruiz, the extravagant Semana Santa, or Holy Week, processions mark the cycle of time in Seville. Without them, he feels unsettled. “You don’t fully wake up if Palm Sunday isn't celebrated,” he said. “The year neither begins nor ends. This is like being trapped in Groundhog Day. Every day is the same as the rest. The feeling is that of a year which has been lost.” In Spain, the virus has claimed tens of thousands of lives, destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs, and jolted even the most fervently maintained traditions. Before the pandemic, Seville would be awash with Easter week crowds gathering to see Catholic brotherhoods hoist “pasos” adorned with Jesus, the Virgin Mary and other figures of the Passion onto their backs and slowly trudge through the streets. The burden of the porters carrying the manual floats contrasts with the beauty of the painted wooden statues; their struggle is joined with the other's glory. This week, Seville residents made do with Mass at the local parish church. They lined up to get inside and had to wear masks and keep a safe distance apart. The Rev. Francisco Ortiz, a priest in Seville’s Nuestra Señora de La Candelaria parish, hopes that faith can ease the physical, emotional and material pain caused by the yearlong virus crisis. “This celebration is bittersweet,” Ortiz said. “We are happy to be able to celebrate Mass together once again. It is a joy that helps us live with the anguish and bitterness that has made many people’s lives worse. There are many people in this neighborhood who are poorer than ever.” The absence of the thousands of tourists who normally flock to Seville has forced merchants with businesses built around the processions to adapt. “For our business, the cancellation of Easter Week festivities has been a disaster,” said Inmaculado Serrano, who makes embroidered embellishments for the outfits worn by brotherhood members. “We have been able to keep the shop open thanks to having reinvented ourselves into makers of face masks."" María Morilla said she was grateful simply to have made it to another Easter. “Easter Week is about more than just the processions,"" she said. ""We Catholics and members of the brotherhoods are people who know how to wait.” ——— Joseph Wilson contributed to this report from Barcelona."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/young-professionals-cut-ahead-older-italians-vaccine-76850400,business,"ROME -- Octogenarians in Tuscany watched in disbelief and indignation as lawyers, magistrates, professors and other younger professionals got vaccinated against COVID-19 before them, despite government pledges of prioritizing  ’s oldest citizens. Even some of their adult children jumped ahead of them. By one estimate, the failure to give shots to the over-80s and those in fragile health has cost thousands of lives in a country with Europe’s oldest population and its second-highest loss of life in the pandemic. As the elderly were elbowed aside, a dozen prominent senior citizens in Tuscany published a letter calling out the authorities, including the region's governor, for what they said was a violation of their health care rights enshrined in the Italian Constitution. “We asked ourselves, ‘What’s the reason for this disparity?’” said signatory Enzo Cheli, a retired constitutional court judge who is a month shy of 87. By late March, he still hadn't been vaccinated, three months into Italy’s inoculation campaign. “The appeal was born of this idea that errors were being made, abuses,’’ Cheli said in a telephone interview from his country home near Siena. He noted that investigations are underway in Tuscany and other regions where professionals received priority status. Those over 80 in Tuscany have the lowest vaccination rate nationally. Another signatory was 85-year-old editorial cartoonist Emilio Giannelli, who hasn't been vaccinated, while his son, a lawyer, has. A Giannelli cartoon appeared on the front page of Corriere della Sera depicting a young man in a business jacket kicking an old man leaning on a cane out of a vaccine line. In a country where many citizens have learned not to count on often weak national governments, outsize influence is wielded by lobbying groups, sometimes derided as “castes.” Premier Mario Draghi has decried such “contractual clout,” saying last month that the “basic line is the need to vaccinate the most fragile people and the over-80s.” His government insists that vaccinations proceed in descending order by age, with the only exceptions being school and university employees, security forces, prison personnel and inmates, and those in communal residences such as convents. According to a calculation by the ISPI think tank, opening vaccination rolls to younger Italians cost 6,500 lives from mid-January through March, a period in which nearly 28,000 died. ISPI researcher Matteo Villa said any decision to vaccinate non-health care professionals who face infection risks should have been limited to those 50 and older. “If we give 100   to people over 90, we save 13 lives,"" Villa said in a phone interview, citing mortality rates. “But it takes 100,000   to 20- to 29-year-olds to save just one life.” The current average age of pandemic dead in Italy is 81. Throughout the pandemic, the oldest Italians have made up the majority of deaths, and not just in Tuscany. Just before Draghi sounded the alarm about lobbying groups, journalists in the small region of Molise had been poised to get early vaccinations. In Lombardy, veterinarians were given priority. In Campania, the region including Naples, drug company salespeople got priority status. Regional leaders blame vaccine delivery delays, alleging the previous government's vaccine rollout opened the door to lobbying groups. Some regions like Lazio, which includes Rome, resisted their pressure. By the end of March, nearly 64% of those 80 and older in Lazio had received at least one COVID-19 shot, compared with 40% in Tuscany. Speaking about society's most fragile, Lazio Gov. Nicola Zingaretti told the Corriere della Sera newspaper: “It's true everyone risks getting COVID, but the difference is that they are among those who, if they catch it, risk dying more than others."" Of Italy's 4.4 million residents 80 or older, fewer than 29% had been vaccinated, and another 27% had gotten only the first dose by the end of March, said the GIMBE foundation, which monitors health care in Italy. That compares with 95% of that age group in Malta who have received at least one dose, and 85% in Finland, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Italy. In Britain, where the vaccine rollout began roughly a month before the EU's, most of the over-50s have received at least one dose. GIMBE official Renata Gili linked much of Italy's uneven performance to varying organizational capabilities as well as “an excess of autonomy in regions in the choice of priority categories to vaccinate.” Some lobbying groups aren't backing down. The National Magistrates Association, which represents most of Italy’s more than 9,600 magistrates, threatened to further slow down the snail-paced judicial system if they aren't given priority. On Thursday, the tourism lobby demanded priority vaccines for its workers, describing them as essential to the country's recovery. On Friday, a top Health Ministry official, Giovanni Rezza, sought to cut off any more jockeying for priority. “There was a struggle between categories'' to get vaccine priority, Rezza told a news conference when asked if supermarket clerks could get special status. “We said, ‘Let’s finish the teachers, the security forces, but let's not have any more categories.' We simply will use criteria of age.” The army general who was tapped last month by Draghi to shake up Italy's COVID-19 vaccination campaign acknowledges its widespread problems. “Is everything going well? No,’’ Gen. Francesco Figliuolo told reporters Wednesday in Milan. Just how many people in Italy received priority vaccines isn't known. Tuscany's health commission office said that before Draghi pulled the plug on special interest groups, 10,319 lawyers, magistrates, courthouse clerks and personnel had received a dose in the region. Allowing lawyers and others to have quick access to vaccines is “an issue, and everyone is pissed off about it,’’ said Nathan Levi, an antiques dealer in Florence who turns 83 next month and is still waiting. “That’s what Italy is all about. The people who put the pressure” get ahead. Of the 10.6 million doses so far administered in Italy, around 1.6 million went to people categorized as ’’other,” prompting some politicians to demand to know who they are. When questioned, Figliuolo’s office admitted it has no idea and said it was pressing the regions for specific details. Italians in their 70s, who are largely out of the workforce, are still waiting for their shots. By March 31, only 8% had received a first dose and fewer than 2% had received both. Then there are people in fragile health, who have a priority category on the government's rollout chart. “The situation for the ‘fragile’ is one of huge uncertainty,’’ said Francesca Lorenzi, a 48-year-old lawyer in Milan with breast cancer. She noted that if cancer patients have finished therapy more than six months ago, they are no longer considered “fragile.” “Meanwhile, they gave doses of Pfizer to 60-year-olds in great health because they have university contracts. I don’t understand why a university professor or a lawyer should get vaccinated before the others,” she said. ——— Colleen Barry reported from Milan.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/explainer-amazon-union-vote-count-76852833,business,"If you want your bottle of laundry detergent or shipment of toilet paper,   can get it to your doorstep the next day. But if you want to know how workers at an   warehouse voted on whether or not to unionize, you're going to have to wait. The final day for the nearly 6,000 workers in Bessemer, Alabama to cast their ballots was March 29. But it could take several more days or even weeks to review and tally everything before we know the outcome. The vote itself has garnered national attention because of the potentially wide-reaching implications. Labor organizers hope a win in Bessemer will inspire thousands of workers nationwide — and not just at Amazon — to consider unionizing. For Amazon, it would mean a big blow to its profits and could alter its business operations. Here's what we know about the vote: WHAT DO ORGANIZERS WANT? Besides higher pay, they want Amazon to give warehouse workers more break time and to be treated with respect. Many complain about their back-breaking 10-hour workdays with only two 30-minute breaks. Workers are on their feet for most of that time, packing boxes, shelving products or unpacking goods that arrive in trucks. WHAT’S AMAZON’S RESPONSE? Amazon argues the warehouse created thousands of jobs with an average pay of $15.30 per hour — more than twice the minimum wage in Alabama. Workers also get benefits including health care, vision and dental insurance without paying union dues, the company said. HOW ARE THE VOTES BEING TALLIED? The National Labor Relations Board, which is overseeing the process, is going through the votes with representatives from Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Names and signatures are being reviewed, but not how those workers voted, which will be done afterwards in an anonymous tally. Voters put their ballots in two envelopes to keep the vote secret. Amazon or the retail union could contest those votes for various reasons, such as the person no longer works at the warehouse or has a job title that disqualifies them. Any contested votes will be set aside and remain unopened. Then, the other “yes"" or “no"" votes will be counted. Members of the media will be able to watch that count through a livestream. Which side wins is determined by a majority of the votes cast. WHEN WILL WE KNOW THE RESULTS? That part is still unclear. A lot depends on how many people voted. The NLRB has not released a figure on the number of ballots submitted, nor how many have been contested so far. If the number of contested votes are enough to change the final outcome, hearings may be held to have those votes counted. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE UNION WINS? Amazon would need to start negotiating a contract with the New York-based RWDSU, which is leading the organizing efforts for Bessemer warehouse employees and represents 100,000 workers at poultry plants; cereal and soda bottling facilities; and retailers such as Macy’s and H&M. But the company could file objections to the vote or start legal battles, delaying the contract negotiations by weeks, months or even longer. In the past, labor experts said employers have done all kinds of things to not recognize a union, including closing stores or warehouses. In 2005, for example, Walmart closed a store in Canada where some 200 workers were close to winning a union contract. At the time, Walmart said demands from union negotiators made it impossible for the store to sustain itself. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE UNION LOSES? The retail union could file unfair labor practice charges against Amazon based on the company's conduct during the election to influence the outcome. Under that scenario, the union says the NLRB would schedule a hearing and determine if the election results should be set aside because the employer “created an atmosphere of confusion or fear of reprisals"" for workers. If that happens, the election results may be overturned or another election takes place. ————— Follow Joseph Pisani on Twitter: @         josephpisani"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/child-care-covid-rising-job-market-faces-obstacles-76853064,business,"WASHINGTON -- A surge in hiring in the United States last month —          916,000 added jobs, the most since August — coincides with growing confidence that a blistering pace of job growth will continue as vaccinations increase and federal aid fuels economic growth. The most optimistic economists even predict that between now and year’s end, the nation could produce as many as 10 million more jobs and restore the labor market to its pre-pandemic level. Maybe so. Yet even in normal times, it would be hard to regain all those jobs so quickly. And these aren't normal times. Many people who've been thrown out of the labor force remain fearful of the coronavirus and reluctant to take face-to-face service jobs. Millions of women are still caring for children attending school online — and can't take jobs because they can't find or afford child care. Extended unemployment aid has meant that some employers might have to pay more to attract workers, which they may feel unable to do. And some people will need new skills before they can land a job to replace the one they lost. While few doubt that the trillions in federal money flowing through the economy will help accelerate hiring, the challenges are sure to endure. Here's a look at some of them: ——— HEALTH FEARS For now, a sizable majority of Americans remain unvaccinated. And after weeks of sharp declines, the number of daily infections is creeping back up. Recruiters say that trend is discouraging some of the unemployed from taking jobs. “People are afraid to come to work — there is some of that,"" said Tammy Browning, president of KellyOCG, a staffing agency. Eventually, ongoing vaccinations ought to gradually reduce such fears, although a portion of Americans remain hesitant to get vaccinated. Browning also suggested that employers will need to become more creative about making workers feel comfortable on the job. Many of her firm's clients are manufacturing companies. On many hot factory floors, their employees have to wear masks and gloves for eight or more hours a day. Companies should consider providing more break times, Browning said, and allow workers to remove their masks outside or in socially distant break rooms. As a single mother, Jennifer Knapp of Augusta, Maine, worries about what a return to work would mean for her and her children's health. A year ago, Knapp, 44, lost her job as a receptionist at a hotel and spa, a place she described as a “hub of germs.” “There is work out there, if you want to put yourself at risk,” she said. But the open jobs she sees are typically temporary and offer low pay. Right now, Knapp is living off savings, child support payments from her ex-husband and unemployment aid. Like many parents, she'd like to find a work-from-home job, ideally in her field of psychology and social work. “The goal,"" she said, “is to get back out there and work, as long as my kids are doing OK.” ——— NEED FOR CHILD CARE Nearly 2.5 million women lost jobs and stopped looking for work during the pandemic. In most cases, experts say, it was because so many children were suddenly stuck at home, going to school online, and their parents lacked available or affordable child care. Better child care options or more flexible work schedules would be needed to fully reverse that trend. Some such change is becoming evident as schools and child care centers reopen. About 500,000 women returned to the labor force in March and found jobs. The improvement could continue in the coming months: Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the job listings website, says job openings at child care centers are growing, a sign that more of these centers are back in business. Recruiters also say flexible or hybrid work schedules, along with benefits for part-time workers, may be critical in attracting job seekers, especially women. More companies could provide on-site child care. “I think it is going to require some systemic changes by employers,"" said Karen Fichuk, chief executive of Randstad North America, a recruiting firm. ——— EXTENDED JOBLESS AID Recruiters say the $300-a-week federal unemployment benefit that was provided by President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID aid package, on top of regular state jobless benefits that average about $340 a week, might have made it harder for some employers to find workers. For some job seekers, especially those fearful of the virus, part-time or temporary jobs at restaurants or stores that may pay less than their unemployment aid, aren't much of an alternative. Economic research suggests that unemployment benefits generally don't deter workers from taking jobs: A study by the         JPMorgan Chase Institute found that last year's federal unemployment payment didn't discourage recipients from working. But the new $300-a-week federal supplement is set to last six months — longer than the previous payment did. “It’s a much more attractive benefit now,"" said Julia Pollak, an economist at ZipRecruiter. ""It would be foolish to think that wouldn’t have any effect.” Economists have calculated that roughly half the unemployed are earning more from benefits than they did at their former jobs. Another factor is that jobless benefits normally require the unemployed to document their efforts to seek a job in order to remain eligible. But during the pandemic, most states have suspended this requirement. That means there is less incentive to job hunt. Browning said her firm is advising clients to pay more and offer other benefits, including bonuses, to offset the extended jobless aid. Six months ago, a client raised the hourly rate for a temporary position by $4 an hour. The proportion of jobs filled, she said, jumped from 35% to 98%. “You really have to encourage people to come back to work,"" Browning said, “and that means pay at the level the market is demanding.” ——— NEED FOR NEW SKILLS For some of the unemployed, their old job appears gone for good. In some cases, their former employers have learned to operate with fewer workers. Landing a job will require finding work in a new occupation or industry — perhaps only after obtaining job training. This takes time. Many economists expect more companies to help reskill workers themselves, particularly if they become desperate to hire. Should the unemployment rate keep declining, businesses might have little choice. “When the economy is running hot, businesses begin to increase training and take risks on someone they might not have hired in the past,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics. ——— OPTIMISM NEEDED For millions of Americans, the past year has meant demoralizing job losses — sometimes multiple layoffs — and fruitless job searches, leading many to give up on finding work. As an example, the number of people who said they want a job but were too discouraged to look for one in the past month didn’t change in March. That was true even though several job search websites report that job postings have risen sharply in recent weeks. For discouraged workers, Pollak said, it can take time to regain confidence. “There are many job seekers who haven’t yet realized how rapidly the conditions in the labor market have changed,” she said. “Many searched for work earlier during the pandemic, when it was most difficult and frustrating to do so, and are now discouraged.”"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/latest-germany-faces-crisis-trust-amid-pandemic-76850837,business,"ROME — Italy has entered a three-day strict nationwide lockdown to deter Easter travel and help prevent new surges of the coronavirus. Even though the Health Ministry says the rate of infections is coming down, all regions were placed into the strictest “red zone” lockdown through Monday as a precaution. The lockdown, announced last month, means restrictions on personal movement, with limited travel and visits to relatives. Non-essential shops are closed and restaurants and bars are only open for take-out. Police set up road checks to ensure people were staying close to home. Extra patrols were ordered up to break up large gatherings in squares and parks, which over Easter weekend are usually packed with picnic goers. Italy, where the European outbreak began, has recorded 3.6 million cases and more than 110,000 deaths from the coronavirus, more deaths than any other European country but Britain. It has administered 10.8 million vaccines, though only 3.3 million of the country’s 60 million people have received both doses. ——— THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: —           for vaccine — UK regulator reports           linked to AstraZeneca shot — Ukraine hits daily high of 20,000 virus cases — AP PHOTOS: Spain’s Seville settles for          ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at          ,           and          ——— HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: SAN FRANCISCO -- Volunteers in California are working to ensure thousands of farmworkers who daily toil in the fields are receiving coronavirus vaccinations. Farmworkers are particularly vulnerable because they live in crowded housing and travel to farms in packed vehicles. Officials say most farmworkers are eager to get the vaccinations but may not have the ability to sign up online. California was the first state to make agricultural workers eligible for vaccinations, followed by others including Washington, Michigan and Georgia. Arizona hasn’t prioritized farmworkers, but some private growers have offered vaccinations. California is the nation’s top producer of fruits and vegetables, and its growers rely on the labor of as many as 800,000 farmworkers. Some arrive under the H2A visa program that allows employers to hire them legally, but many are hired regardless. Researchers at Purdue University estimate about 9,000 agricultural workers in the U.S. have died of the coronavirus and nearly a half million have been infected. ——— KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine recorded a new daily high of more than 20,000 coronavirus cases. Health Minister Maxim Stepanov says 20,341 new infections were registered in the previous day, nearly 500 more than the record on Friday. Ukraine began vaccinations late February, but only about 230,000 people have received the shots because of widespread reluctance. The sharply rising numbers prompted the mayor of the capital Kyiv to order schools and public transportation closed for two weeks starting Monday. Overall, more than 1.7 million infections and 34,000 confirmed deaths have been recorded during the pandemic. ——— HARRISBURG, Pa. — Vaccine passports developed to verify COVID-19 immunization status have become the latest flash point for some U.S. politicians. Supporters say the passports would allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine. But Republicans portray them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices. Vaccine passports currently exist in only one state -- a limited government partnership in New York with a private company. Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for the coronavirus. They are used in Israel and under development in parts of Europe, considered a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic-devastated travel industry. They are intended to allow businesses to safely open as the vaccine drive gains momentum. They mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases. ——— ISLAMABAD — Pakistan federal authorities will start coronavirus vaccinations for residents over 80 on Monday. The country received 60,000 doses of the CanSino vaccine from China early in the week. Pakistan is already using the Sinopharm vaccine, donated by Beijing last month. The National Command and Control Center says the vaccine administration will begin in all the four provinces for people over age 80. Pakistan reported 4,723 new coronavirus cases and 84 confirmed deaths in the last 24 hours. The country is facing a virus surge, which the government says is worse than last year’s outbreak when a nationwide lockdown was imposed. Pakistan has reported a total of 68,288 cases and 14,697 confirmed deaths. ——— DHAKA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh authorities are imposing a one-week nationwide lockdown on Monday to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Cabinet Minister Obaidul Quader announced the plan on Saturday. The government says 5,683 new infections and 58 deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. Forhad Hossain, the country’s junior minister for public administration, says organizations providing emergency services will be available during the lockdown. He says industries will remain open and employees must work in shifts, following health guidelines. The government has already banned travel from all European countries, except the United Kingdom, and 12 other countries for three weeks. Bangladesh has registered a total of 630,277 cases and 9,213 confirmed deaths. Health experts say the actual number is likely higher. ——— PARIS — French hospitals brought in extra staff for the Easter holiday weekend to cope with more coronavirus patients. With a new virus variant spreading fast and French intensive care units as full as they were last April, the government closed all schools and imposed new rules taking effect nationwide on Sunday. In Paris, police say they’re deploying 6,600 officers to enforce the new restrictions, which include a ban on traveling more than 10 kilometers (6 miles), a ban on outdoor gatherings of six people or more and a continued nationwide 7 p.m. curfew. On the Mediterranean shores of Marseille, police patrolled amid sunbathers and fined people drinking in public or not wearing masks. Crowds filled Paris-area train stations on Friday night to head to the countryside. The SNCF national rail authority says its expecting 600,000 people to travel over the weekend. France has registered 4.8 million coronavirus cases, the most in Europe and fourth globally. It’s confirmed more than 96,000 deaths, eighth highest in the world. The U.S. leads with 30.6 million cases and more than 554,000 confirmed deaths. ——— BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentine President Alberto Fernández says he had an initial positive test for coronavirus, despite having been vaccinated in January. Fernández sent a tweet Friday saying took a quick antigen test for the virus after feeling a headache and fever. He says other than light symptoms, he is “physically well” and isolating. He adds he’s awaiting a confirmation of the result using a more rigorous PCR test. The president received a dose of the Sputnik V vaccine on Jan. 21 and a second dose a few days later. The Russian Gamaleya Institute, which produced the vaccine, tweeted the shot has a 91.6% rate of effectiveness against infection and 100% against critical cases. “If the infection is confirmed and occurred, the vaccination assures a rapid recovery without severe symptoms,” it said. Argentina recently tightened border restrictions following a surge in cases. It has administered more than 4 million doses of vaccine. The nation of 45 million has registered nearly 2.4 million infections and 56,000 confirmed deaths. ——— LONDON — Britain’s medicines regulator is urging people to continue taking the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, despite revealing seven people in the U.K. have died from rare blood clots after getting the shot. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, says it isn’t clear if the shots are causing the clots. It says its “rigorous review into the U.K. reports of rare and specific types of blood clots is ongoing.” Though the agency said late Friday that seven people had died as a result of developing blood clots, it didn’t disclose any information about their ages or health conditions. In total, MHRA says it's identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million AstraZeneca doses administered through March 24. Concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine prompted some countries to restrict its use to older people. The World Health Organization has urged countries to continue using the shot. ——— NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya has ordered a suspension on private importations of vaccines. The National Emergency Response Committee says the move is meant to ensure transparency and accountability in the process of vaccinations. Private health facilities have been charging about $80 for the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, while the governments institutions are giving free AstraZeneca vaccines received from the global COVAX initiative. In recent weeks, the Kenyan government has been on a sensitization campaign to reduce the reluctance of frontline workers to take the AstraZeneca vaccine. About 160,000 people have been vaccinated in more than a month since 1 million doses were received. President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 26 led his cabinet in getting vaccinated publicly after announcing stricter restrictions on movement and assembly due to a surge of coronavirus cases and deaths. Kenya’s government says the country’s positivity rate increased from 2.6% at the end of January to 19.1% on April 2. ——— FRANKFURT, Germany — Germany’s president says the country is enduring a “crisis of trust” as it weathers a second Easter under pandemic restrictions amid dissatisfaction over the government’s response. In the text of an address to be broadcast Saturday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier conceded “there were mistakes” regarding testing, digital solutions and vaccinations. He urged Germans not to wallow in the negative but to pull together and trust approved vaccines. Germany, along with the European Union as a whole, has lagged some countries in the speed of its vaccination effort amid the slower procurement of vaccines because of supply and distribution issues from the vaccine companies. He pointed out vaccine deliveries would increase sharply in the coming weeks and both citizens and government had to pull together and not “outdo each other in pessimism.” ——— ROME — Octogenarians in Tuscany watched in disbelief and indignation as lawyers, magistrates, professors and other younger professionals got vaccinated against COVID-19 before them, despite government pledges of prioritizing Italy’s oldest citizens. Even some of their adult children jumped ahead of them. By one estimate, Italy’s failure to prioritize the over-80s and those with fragile health conditions has cost thousands of lives in a country with Europe’s oldest population and its second-highest loss of life in the pandemic. As the elderly were elbowed aside, a dozen prominent senior citizens in Tuscany published a letter calling out the authorities for what they said was a violation of their health care rights enshrined in Italy’s Constitution. ——— SEVILLE, Spain — Few Roman Catholics in devout southern Spain would have imagined an April without the pomp and ceremony of Holy Week processions. With the coronavirus pandemic unremitting, they will miss them for a second year. The streets of Seville and other Spanish cities again went without Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday celebrations marking the life, death and resurrection of Christ. The infection rate for coronavirus is still too high for groups to gather. For 50-year-old Roberto Ruiz, the extravagant Semana Santa, or Holy Week, processions mark the cycle of time in Seville. Without them, he feels unsettled. “You don’t fully wake up if Palm Sunday isn’t celebrated,” he said. “The year neither begins nor ends. This is like being trapped in Groundhog Day. Every day is the same as the rest. The feeling is that of a year which has been lost.” ——— SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s daily increase in coronavirus infections exceeded 500 for the fourth straight day, a pace unseen since January, as experts raise concern about another viral surge amid a slow rollout in vaccines. The 543 new cases reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Saturday brought the national caseload to 104,736, including 1,740 deaths. More than 320 of the new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of the country’s 51 million people, where officials have struggled to stem transmissions tied to various places, including bars, offices, factories, schools, and gyms. Health authorities this week said they are considering whether to approve rapid coronavirus tests that would allow people to regularly test themselves at home as they look for further tools to fight the virus. South Korea has wrestled with a slower rollout of vaccines than many other developed economies, with officials insisting they could afford a wait-and-see approach as its outbreak isn’t as dire as in the United States or Europe. ——— SAN FRANCISCO — California cleared the way for people to attend indoor concerts, theater performances and NBA games for the first time in more than a year as the rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus in the state nears a record low. State officials won’t require testing or proof of vaccination for some of those events, but they do limit the number of people allowed to attend. Events that do require testing and vaccinations will be allowed to have more paying customers than those that don’t. Only people who live in California can attend these live performances. The rules are different for private indoor gatherings, including weddings, meetings or conferences. Those are only to be allowed if all guests test negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance or show proof of full vaccination. ———"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/dont-afraid-automakers-encourage-drivers-bold-cars/story?id=76799932,business,"Dee Quon had a mission. The Southern California resident and longtime MINI Cooper devotee wanted a black John Cooper Works Hardtop 2 Door equipped with every single package available and a piano black interior trim. Red stripes painted on the hood, too. Quon searched and searched for her dream car at local dealerships. The result was always the same: No. ""A lot of dealers build what sells the most,"" she told ABC News. ""I was looking for certain options."" So Quon went online, placed a custom order and waited three months for her JCW MINI to arrive from the British automaker's plant in Oxford, U.K. The plant manager and the quality assurance manager even signed the inside of the hood, making her car a rarity. The agonizing wait was well worth it, she said. ""It's more personalized. Embrace the process -- it's fun,"" she promised. Quon is not alone. Customization has become a thriving business for automakers, with a solid contingent of motorists speccing their vehicles to reflect their personalities -- and wallets. Luxury brands Rolls-Royce and Bentley are still at the forefront of coachbuilding and the business of bespoke, assembling special, one-off conveyances for well-heeled clients. But now mainstream brands like MINI, Volkswagen and Ford are getting into the highly lucrative game. ""Customization is hugely profitable for automakers,"" Ivan Drury, a senior manager at Edmunds, told ABC News. ""Trends come and go so quickly. People want to stand out more. It's a cultural phenomenon."" Drury also pointed out that a specialty trim or distinct feature could increase the vehicle's future resell value. Truck owners in particular are likely to add up to $40,000 in options, selecting every off-roading package and accessory that's available, Drury said. ""The appetite for these options with customers is insatiable,"" he noted. ""Pre-ordering cars is becoming more normalized, especially for people who can play at these price points. People don't want to compromise."" Color, leather, stitching, wood veneers, monograms -- the possibilities (and the imagination) are endless. Here's how some automakers are helping customers stand out on the road and from each other. The uber wealthy turn to the 115-year-old British marque for over-the-top opulence and personalization. Coachbuilding is part of the company's DNA and specialists, carrying briefcases of samples, will fly to clients' yachts, chateaus and penthouse apartments to design a tailor-made vehicle. Will Vetter, product and bespoke manager at Rolls-Royce, said he's worked with customers for more than a year to finalize a concept. ""Configuring a car can be overwhelming. The levels of choices sometimes are daunting,"" Vetter admitted to ABC News. ""We have extensive training for dealers."" About 80% of all Rolls-Royces are specially designed by owners, though some clients, primarily in the U.S., are happy to buy whatever's available on hand. ""The U.S. is an instant gratification market,"" Vetter said. Rolls-Royce recently launched 80-page digital brochures to help clients get familiar with the bespoke process. Options include two-tone exteriors, personalized motifs on the C-pillar, pinstripe wheels, a solid silver or gold plated Spirit of Ecstasy, colored stitching, door embossing, contrasting lambswool floor mats, commissioned umbrellas, the list goes on. The 2021 Ghost, for example, comes with an illuminated fascia made up of 850 stars that took 10,000 hours to craft, a feature that's only found in the newly refreshed sedan. Of course, a Rolls-Royce customer can go an entirely different route and proffer a very distinct vision. Enthusiast and collector Jack Boyd Smith Jr. of Ohio was determined to incorporate Koa wood, a rare species of tree that grows only in Hawaii and is protected in Hawaiian State and National parks, in his new Rolls-Royce Phantom. Smith and his wife were so committed to the design that they waited three years for Rolls-Royce to source a supply and complete the car, now nicknamed the ""Koa Phantom."" The Dove Grey leather interior was also custom matched to Smith's 1934 Packard Twelve Coupe and a bespoke starlight headliner, consisting of 1,420 fiber-optic lights, replicates the constellation of the night sky above Cleveland, Ohio, on Smith’s birth date. Vetter said the company will accommodate nearly all requests. There are some restrictions, though. ""We have to abide by federal vehicle safety standards,"" he said. The iconic Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament? ""She is off limits."" ""Be brave. There is amazing stuff you can do."" Paul Williams is speaking from experience. A 14-year veteran of Bentley Motors, Williams took over the British automaker's Mulliner division a year ago. He and his growing team of 50 work closely with clients to perfect their Bentleys and deliver one-of-a-kind examples. ""Mulliner is well known,"" he told ABC News. ""We're seeing an increase in demand for personalization, especially in the Middle East. Customers enjoy making the vehicles unique and reflect their personality."" Williams has already received 96 commissions for Flying Spurs, the company's ultra lux sedan that's offered with either a W12 or twin-turbocharged V8 engine. What makes the Flying Spur especially unequaled is the 3D wood paneling inside the cabin, an option that costs $13,400. ""The wood has a diamond quilted feel,"" Williams explained. ""We take a solid piece of wood and machine that into a 3D surface finish. It gives a really beautiful texture. And the wood is treated to last the lifetime of the car."" About 10% of Bentley customers spend the extra effort and money on bespoke creations. And that's fine with Williams, who said Mulliner will always be limited in scope. ""It's a low percentage, but from our perspective, there's so much effort and treatment that makes a car unique,"" he said. ""We can't roll this out broadly."" Williams did acknowledge that bespoke may not appeal to all customers. But it certainly has its advantages. ""It's a challenge when you don't see [the car] in the flesh,"" he said. ""We worked very hard on these visualization tools to give high quality renderings."" He added, ""It's an expression of yourself. Don't be afraid."" Aston Martin’s in-house bespoke division ""Q"" debuted in 2012 and now represents around 10% of annual retail build volumes across Aston's core car range, according to Henry Cozon, head of Q sales. Customers, many of whom are loyal to the brand, are willing to pay more for hand-made quilted leather flooring, specific colors and chrome detailing. Nearly 5% of retail orders for the DBX, Aston's first-ever SUV, come via the Q Commission team, Cozon told ABC News. ""We have recently developed a full carbon fiber boot floor for DBX and also a bespoke jewelry pack that is machined from billet aluminum and only available on DBX,"" he said. It takes on average six months for a Q commissioned car to be complete and owners are invited to visit the factory in Gaydon, U.K., for the car's grand reveal. Q has delivered over 2,000 customer commissions since launching. ""We constantly receive interesting and unusual requests and customers often take inspiration from the most abstract of sources and we work with them to translate this onto their car,"" said Cozon. ""That’s the beauty of Q – it allows customers to fully express their personality and also reflects their lifestyle and achievements."" One of Ford's most anticipated vehicles in more than a decade, the Bronco 4X4 has more than 200 factory-backed accessories for maximum personalization. The off-road modular design platform can be stripped to its base so that doors, fenders and grilles can be added and removed easily. No two Broncos should ever be alike, according to the Dearborn automaker. ""We've seen a tremendous amount of interest in our accessory offerings,"" Esteban Plaza-Jennings, Bronco's product manager, told ABC News. ""We're making Bronco as welcoming to the novice as it is to the enthusiast."" The Bronco configurator site lets interested buyers ""Pick your adventure"" to help tailor the SUV to their needs. Twelve paint colors are available now, with a green arriving in 2022. ""The vehicle is flexible. It's designed around customization,"" Plaza-Jennings said. ""There are so many awesome accessories unique to Bronco."" The accessories and options -- racks, lights, winches, roofs, fender flares -- can quickly push up the vehicle's MSRP. The Sasquatch Package, which includes 35-inch wheels, costs several thousand dollars. ""It's easy to spend over $10K in options,"" Plaza-Jennings acknowledged. And the customization comes straight from the factory, similar to what Rolls-Royce and Bentley provide, he noted. Custom orders are up 30% at MINI, according to Patrick McKenna, head of product planning at MINI USA. Limited inventory has partly led to the surge, McKenna said. But generally about 20% of customers, like Quon, prefer to dream up their own personalized cars. And the options are almost limitless. Exterior color is key but graphics, like the Union Jack, and contrasting colors for the roof and exterior mirror caps are some of the most popular and stylish ways to accessorize a MINI. Door bezels are also customizable, taillights can incorporate the Union Jack flag and braided welt trim and contrast stitching join the long list of interior options. Handcrafted finishes that are found in premium brands are possible as well: Real wood that's sliced thin, stained in dark gray and carefully arranged; aluminum plating embossed with a fine herringbone pattern that is reminiscent of English tweed. ""Every car can be custom built and consumers are using their car as a canvas,"" McKenna said. ""We call it 'you-ification.'"" Still, owners won't end up with a ""Frankenstein car,"" he added. ""We've taken some of those risks out. We don't want it to be too overwhelming for customers."" This year MINI gave owners yet another way to personalize their vehicles: A multitone roof that required MINI to develop a new painting technique. Three color shades are applied in a wet-on-wet painting process, an industry first that will be done on the factory line. ""It takes the brand's hallmark ex works customization options to a new level,"" according to Oliver Heilmer, head of MINI Design. ""And because every roof looks a little bit different and is so unique, it pays to look closely more than ever."" Megan Closset has high hopes Volkswagen's Spektrum Program will return -- and quickly. The product manager for VW's Golf oversaw the program in 2019, which marked the final model year for the 7th generation Golf R. The program was hailed by VW fans who longed for ways to customize their sporty, high performance hot hatch. ""The Spektrum Program was a really special opportunity,"" Closset told ABC News. ""It brought excitement to the cars. Color alone is increasing [in popularity] in the performance segment."" The 199 U.S. customers who were able to snap up one of these Golf Rs were given a choice of 40 custom colors in addition to five standard colors. The custom colors ranged from Nogaro Blue Pearl and Violet Touch Metallic to Viper Green Metallic and Copper Orange Metallic and cost $2,500. The cars were hand sprayed at a small paint shop in Germany and owners had to wait an additional two to four months for delivery. Closset even sent handwritten cards to owners, many of whom have either framed or tucked the card away for safekeeping. ""This was a challenge for VW of America and dealers. We had never done this before,"" she explained. ""We dipped our toes into this new custom paint adventure."" The eighth generation Golf R is expected to arrive in the U.S. by the end of the year. The Spektrum Program, however, may be finished for good. Closset is still rooting for its comeback. ""It's top of mind for me,"" she said. ""We will apply pressure to make it happen."" Land Rover recently unveiled new Range Rover special editions that highlight the brand's Special Vehicle Operations Technical Centre in the U.K. The 2021 Range Rover SVAutobiography Ultimate SUVs ""showcase the full range of personalization touches that can be applied to the timeless Range Rover design,"" according to the company. The SUVs come with illuminated Ultimate edition treadplates, knurled infill and copper-edged metal Range Rover badging on the hood and tailgate, vintage tan leather interior trim and copper weave carbon fiber finishers. Customers can also opt for leather upholstery from the Italian artisans at Poltrona Frau for a ""truly cosseting experience,"" the company said. German automaker BMW will take a customer's favorite color -- matte, metallic, pearlescent -- and apply it to the vehicle as part of the company's Individual program. An online visualizer assists in the process. Exclusive interiors, special equipment, monograms and leather upholstery are available, too. Not every Porsche customer prefers a white, silver or black 911 or Boxster. Even with a choice of 20 ""standard"" colors, there are a handful of owners -- the company says 1% -- who demand even more customization. And they're willing to pay up. Individual paint jobs are always on the table and the sports car maker encourages customers to explore all options as part of its Exclusive Customer Consultation programs."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amazon-apologizes-congressman-bogus-peeing-tweet-76854324,business,"NEW YORK -- Amazon is sorry for tweeting about peeing. The company apologized in a late Friday         blog post for a tweet it sent to a congressman more than a week ago denying that its employees work so hard they must urinate in empty water bottles. It also admitted that some delivery drivers might have had to urinate in bottles and it vowed to improve their working conditions. The matter was first raised March 24 by   U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who responded to a tweet by an   executive that said the company was a progressive workplace. “Paying workers $15/hr doesn’t make you a ‘progressive workplace’ when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles,” Pocan said in his         tweet. Amazon         responded: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us.” In the Friday night blog post,   apologized to Pocan and acknowledged that delivery drivers “can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes.” The online shopping giant said COVID-19 has made the issue worse, since many public restrooms are closed. “Sigh,” Pocan responded in a Saturday morning         tweet. “This is not about me, this is about your workers—who you don’t treat with enough respect or dignity.” Amazon wrote in its blog post that urinating in bottles is an industry-wide problem. To try and prove its point, it shared links to news articles about drivers for other delivery companies who have had to do so. “Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it,” the company said. “We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions.” Amazon's treatment of workers has been a hot topic recently as it faces the         biggest union push in its history at an Alabama warehouse. Organizers there are pushing for more break time and better pay, with many complaining about the back-breaking 10-hour workdays that include only two 30-minute breaks. Seattle-based Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment. ————— Follow Joseph Pisani on Twitter: @         josephpisani"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-regulator-reports-30-clot-cases-linked-astrazeneca-76850734,business,"LONDON -- Britain’s medicines regulator is urging people to continue taking the AstraZeneca   vaccine, despite revealing that seven people in the U.K. have died from rare blood clots after getting the jab. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, said it wasn't clear if the shots are causing the clots, and that its “rigorous review into the U.K. reports of rare and specific types of blood clots is ongoing.” Though the agency said late Friday that seven people had died as a result of developing blood clots, it didn’t disclose any information about their ages or   conditions. In total, MHRA said it had identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million AstraZeneca doses administered up to and including March 24. The risk associated with this type of blood clot is “very small,” it added. “The benefits of COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca in preventing COVID-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so,” said Dr. June Raine, the agency’s chief executive. Concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine have already prompted some countries including Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands to restrict its use to older people. The U.K., which has rolled out coronavirus   faster than other European nations, is particularly reliant on the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. It has also been using the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, of which the agency has not seen any reported blood clot events. Figures Saturday showed that the U.K. has given a first dose of vaccine to 31.4 million people, or around 46% of its population, a much higher rate than the rest of Europe. Delivering second doses is the priority for April, with 5.2 million people now having received two jabs. The relative success of the country's vaccination program has been credited for helping to sharply reduce new coronavirus infections in the U.K. after a winter surge, paving the way for a modest easing of lockdown restrictions on gatherings. On Saturday, the U.K. recorded another 3,423 infections, slightly up on the previous day's six-month low of 3,402. It also recorded only 10 coronavirus-related deaths, its lowest daily total since early September. Despite the improved coronavirus backdrop, the U.K. has recorded Europe’s highest COVID-related death toll, with over 126,500 deaths. In France, which has restricted use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people over 55, the family of a 38-year-old woman who died after suffering post-vaccination blood clots in the brain filed a criminal complaint in Toulouse on Saturday seeking a manslaughter investigation. She is among four people in France who died after suffering blood clots in the weeks after getting an AstraZeneca vaccine shot. France’s national medicine safety agency says it is investigating those cases and eight other cases of severe blood clotting in people who survived. MHRA's view about the relative benefits of the vaccine is shared by the European Medicines Agency. It has said a causal link between unusual blood clots in people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine is “not proven, but is possible,"" and that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of side effects. The World Health Organization has also urged countries to continue using the jab. Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol, said the “extreme rarity” of the blood-clotting events in the context of the millions of jabs administered in the U.K. makes the decision very straightforward. “Receiving the vaccine is by far the safest choice in terms of minimizing individual risk of serious illness or death,” he said. ——— Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/groups-venice-lagoon-risk-cruise-ship-decree-76854068,business,"ROME -- Activists opposed to cruise ships in Venice are seeking a meeting with the Italian government to argue that its latest proposal to re-route big ships away from St. Mark’s Square doesn’t address pressing environmental concerns about the fragile Venetian lagoon. The Italian Cabinet passed a decree this week calling for a public tender of ideas to create a new docking port “outside the protected waters of the lagoon.” Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said the decree addresses longstanding UNESCO concerns and establishes that cargo and cruise ships bigger than 40,000 tons must dock outside the lagoon. While it’s not articulated in the decree, the temporary plan would have big ships use the Marghera Port on the Italian mainland until a definitive solution is found and implemented — a potentially years-long process. “Whoever has been to Venice in recent years, either an Italian or foreigner, has been upset seeing these ships — hundreds of meters long and high as a condo — pass by such fragile places as the Giudecca Canal or in front of St. Mark’s Square,” Franceschini said. He called the decree a “very important” way to come up with a definitive new solution. But the No Big Ships Committee, a coalition of activists, said the Marghera Port is still part of the Venetian lagoon and therefore must be rejected even as a temporary solution. The new route envisaged would take ships past the tail of the Lido and then hug the Italian mainland via the Oil Canal, away from Venice’s historic center but still into the lagoon and up to Marghera. “It’s certainly a relief to hear the Italian government finally state its intention to keep large ships out of the lagoon as well as block them from coming close to Venice,"" said Jane da Mosto of the We Are Here Venice group, which is part of the No Big Ships coalition. “But the interim ‘temporary’ plan to bring large cruise ships to Marghera will not protect the lagoon,” she said in an email. “This new route will still damage its fragile ecosystem, with inevitable negative knock-on effects."" The issue has simmered in Venice for years. The fragile Italian canal city depends tourism, even though the coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to that industry in the last year. But opponents of cruise ship tourism say the ships are out-of-scale for Venice, cause pollution, threaten the lagoon’s ecosystem and are a danger. To back up their claims, they cite the 2019 crash of a cruise ship on Venice's main Giudecca Canal that injured five people. The No Big Ships Committee said it was seeking a meeting with the government to argue that the Oil Canal route to Marghera “is not workable.” “Any temporary solution has to be rejected because the risk is too high that it becomes definitive,” the group tweeted. ——— Colleen Barry contributed from Soave, Italy."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ceo-googles-driving-car-spinoff-steps-job-76840526,business,"SAN RAMON, Calif. -- The executive who steered the transformation of Google's self-driving car project into a separate company worth billions of dollars is stepping down after more than five years on the job. John Krafcik announced his departure as CEO of Waymo, a company spun out from Google,         in a Friday blog post that cited his desire to enjoy life as the world emerges from the pandemic. “I'm looking forward to a refresh period, reconnecting with old friends and family, and discovering new parts of the world,"" Krafcik, 59, wrote. Two of Krafcik's top lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs. Dmitri Dolgov, who has been working on self-driving cars since Waymo began within Google in 2009, will focus on the technology for the autonomous vehicles. Tekedra Mawakana, a lawyer who had been Waymo's chief operating officer, will handle the business side of the operation. Krafcik will remain an adviser to Waymo, a company that established itself as the clear leader in autonomous driving since Google hired him in 2015. Not long after that, Google's self-driving division morphed into Waymo, a company owned by Alphabet, which is also Google's parent. Under Krafcik's leadership, Waymo forged partnerships with several major automakers and launched the first ride-hailing service to pick up passengers without a driver or anyone else in the vehicles. That service, called Waymo One, only operates in the Phoenix metropolitan area, but Waymo plans to expand into other markets as the company continues to refine a technology that is expected to transform the auto industry. Waymo's inroads have left it with an estimated market value of about $30 billion, based on analyst estimates made last year         after the company raised $2.25 billion  in its first round of investments from outside Alphabet. Waymo subsequently received $1 billion from outside investors to close that round of financing. But last year's estimated $30 billion valuation was down dramatically from 2018 when a Morgan Stanley research report estimated Waymo was worth about $175 billion. The huge swing reflects the challenges of building self-driving cars that can navigate the roads safely while still dealing with traditional vehicles under the control of humans. That task has proven far more difficult than Waymo and dozens of other companies working on self-driving technology envisioned five or six years ago. For all its progress in autonomous driving, Waymo isn't believed to have ever made money during Krafcik's reign. Waymo doesn't disclose its financial results. It operates within an segment of Alphabet called “Other Bets"" that includes several other far-flung projects financed by the huge profits generated from Google's digital advertising empire. Alphabet's “Other Bets"" have lost nearly $13 billion during the past three years."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pressure-mounts-corporations-denounce-gop-voting-bills-76848495,business,"ATLANTA -- Liberal activists are stepping up calls for corporate America to denounce Republican efforts to tighten state voting laws, and businesses accustomed to cozy political relationships now find themselves in the middle of a growing partisan fight over voting rights. Pressure is mounting on leading companies in         Texas, Arizona and other states, particularly after         Major League Baseball’s decision Friday to move the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta. A         joint statement  from executives at nearly 200 companies, including HP, Microsoft, PayPal, Target, Twitter, Uber and Under Armour, took aim at state legislation “threatening to make voting more difficult"" and said “elections are not improved” when lawmakers impose new barriers to voting. The outcry comes a week after         Georgia Republicans enacted an overhaul of the state's   law that critics argue is an attempt to suppress Democratic votes. Other companies have, somewhat belatedly, joined the chorus of critics. Delta Air Lines and The Coca-Cola Co., two of Georgia’s best-known brands,         this past week called the new law “unacceptable,"" although they had a hand in writing it. That only angered Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp and several U.S. senators, who accused the companies of cowering from unwarranted attacks from the left. The fight has thrust corporate America into a place it often tries to avoid — the center of a partisan political fight. But under threat of boycott and bad publicity, business leaders are showing a new willingness to enter the fray on an issue not directly related to their bottom line, even if it means alienating Republican allies. “We want to hold corporations accountable for how they show up when voting rights are under attack,” said Marc Banks, an NAACP spokesman. “Corporations have a part to play, because when they do show up and speak, people listen.” Kemp said at a news conference Saturday that baseball “caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” and moving the game means ”cancel culture” is coming for American businesses. Kemp said state leaders worked in good faith with leaders in the business community on the legislation, including some of the same companies that have now “flip-flopped on this issue.” He added: “We shouldn’t apologize for making it easy to vote and hard to cheat."" Civil rights groups have sued to block the new Georgia law, which was passed after Democrats flipped the once-reliably Republican state in an   that Donald Trump falsely claimed was rife with fraud. Some activists have called for consumer boycotts of Delta, Coca-Cola and others. They dismiss business leaders’ assertions that they helped water down the bill to ease earlier, more restrictive proposals; those leaders, they argue, should have tried to block the plan altogether. In Texas, the NAACP, League of Women Voters and League of United Latin American Citizens, among other organizations, are urging corporations in the state to speak out against a slate of Republican-backed voting proposals. “Democracy is good for business,” the campaign says. Nine organizations took out full-page ads in The Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News, the state’s leading newspapers, urging corporate opposition to the plan. The Texas proposal would limit some early voting hours, bar counties from setting up drive-thru voting and prohibit local officials from proactively sending applications for mail ballots before voters request them. Unlike their Georgia-based counterparts, American Airlines and Dell Technologies didn’t wait for the Texas measure to pass. “To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” American said in a statement. Arizona, which Biden flipped from Trump in November, hasn’t seen high-profile corporate players engage yet. But 30-plus groups sent a joint letter to Allstate Insurance, CVS Health and Farmers’ Insurance, among others, urging their public opposition to proposed voting restrictions. Emily Kirkland, executive director of Progress Arizona, a progressive group that signed the letter, said there's been no response yet. Other groups are demanding that corporations focus on Washington, where         congressional Democrats are pushing measures intended to make it easier for Americans to vote, regardless of state laws. Among the changes, Democrats would enact automatic voter registration nationally and standardize access to early and mail voting. Democrats also want to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that require the federal government to approve all election procedures in states and locales with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court struck down those provisions, which applied to Georgia and Arizona, among other states, in 2013. Corporate giants were mostly quiet when Trump falsely claimed he lost because of fraud. Business leaders largely maintained that caution as Republican state lawmakers used Trump's lie to justify a flood of new bills to make it more cumbersome to vote. The reticence was a stark contrast to how chambers of commerce reacted six years ago when Republican-run states pushed “religious freedom” measures. Indiana, under then-Gov. Mike Pence, the future vice president, saw immediate corporate backlash. After North Carolina passed a “bathroom bill” limiting LGBTQ rights in 2016, PayPal scuttled expansion plans there and the         NBA moved its all-star game from Charlotte.         An AP analysis in 2017 found the reaction would eventually cost North Carolina at least $3.76 billion in lost business. Then, Georgia’s corporate lobbying groups — with Delta’s and Coca-Cola’s backing — took no such chances, speaking out forcefully against Georgia conservatives' version of a “religious freedom” bill. Lawmakers passed it anyway but Kemp’s predecessor,         Republican Nathan Deal, vetoed it amid the chamber outcry. Today, Delta and Coca-Cola's response to the Georgia voting fight is standing as a cautionary tale for other businesses. Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, initially released a statement noting the business lobby’s role in altering the bill as it moved through the General Assembly. Officials at the Atlanta Metro Chamber, where Bastian currently serves as president, detailed how corporate lobbyists spent weeks at the Capitol on mitigating provisions. Some Georgia Republicans wanted to roll back the state’s no-excuse absentee voting law, end automatic voter registration and ban Sunday early voting used heavily by Black churches. They also wanted to require photocopies of state IDs to receive and submit absentee ballots, while banning “drop boxes” as ballot collection receptacles. The final law preserved no-excuse absentee voting and automatic registration. The new ID requirement for absentee ballots allows a voter to write their state ID number, rather than produce a photocopy, and the legislature included funding for free state IDs. The law also codifies in-person early voting on weekends, although it allows counties to choose whether to be open for voting for up to two Sundays. And it made drop boxes of mail ballots a permanent fixture in Georgia, but limited the number. Business leaders’ philosophy, according to Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan, was “basically, Republicans are going to pass something, so they might as well try to keep from being awful.” But by Wednesday, the same day 72 Black business executives published a letter in The New York Times urging corporate leaders to speak out, Bastian was more direct. He sent a companywide memo declaring the law “unacceptable” and “based on a lie” — though he didn’t mention Trump. Big business’s mistake, Jordan said, was “thinking there was ever any version that wouldn’t end up like this.” ——— Associated Press writers David Koenig in Dallas; Acacia Coronado and Paul J.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/italy-enters-day-easter-lockdown-amid-vaccination-snags-76855617,business,"ROME -- Italy entered a three-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown Saturday to deter Easter travel and get-togethers even as the country's variant-fueled spike in new infections began to wane. The government had announced last month that it would place all regions into the strictest “red zone” lockdown over the Easter weekend to limit the chances of contagion, taking the same precautions it enforced over Christmas and New Year’s. Travel between regions and visits to relatives were being limited through Monday. Nonessential shops were closed and restaurants and bars were only open for take-out. “People are tired, but they are aware that protecting health is essential in these times,” said Maj. Fabio Palletta, a Carabinieri military police officer manning a checkpoint in Rome on Saturday, one of many set up around the country this weekend to ensure people on the roads were authorized to travel. The Interior Ministry also ordered up extra foot police patrols to break up large gatherings in squares and parks, which over Easter are usually packed with picnic-goers. “I’m glad they are doing checks. It means something is working in this whole mess,” said Amato Monatanari, who was pulled over for a check in Rome. Italy, where Europe's outbreak began, has recorded more than 110,000 COVID-19 dead, more than any other European country but Britain. Another 21,000 infections were reported Saturday in  , along with 376 dead. An estimated 87% of  ’s newest cases have been traced to the highly contagious variant first detected in Britain. But the Health Ministry reported Friday that for the second week in a row, new cases had “slightly diminished.” But because Italian hospitals in most regions are still well over their COVID-19 capacity in both intensive care units and other wards, the ministry concluded that new infections were still “too high ... to allow any reduction in current restrictive measures.” Italians, however, are upset over the country's stumbling vaccination campaign, which despite having promised to prioritize older people has left          many of Italy's eldest, most vulnerable people behind while teachers, police officers and other professional workers get their jabs. The Lombardy region, Italy’s biggest, has          suffered more COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other but still has had a faltering vaccination campaign, earning a personal visit this week from Italy’s new virus czar, Gen. Francesco Figliuolo. “There are things that aren’t going well,” Figliuolo said. “We’ll note them, and then we’ll fix them together.” More than three months into Italy’s nationwide vaccination campaign, Lombardy this week opened a new centralized appointment portal after its previous system sent some elderly people hundreds of kilometers (miles) from home to get a jab and left others unable to get an appointment. Lombardy’s embattled regional governor, Attilio Fontana, acknowledged “some difficulties” but insisted that they hadn’t impacted the overall vaccination campaign. He said the criticism of the regional effort was “nauseating.” Italy has administered 10.8 million   nationwide, though only 3.3 million of the country’s 60 million people have received both doses. Lombardy, which counts one sixth of the population and has long prided itself on its health care system, has administered 1.7 million doses. On Saturday in Sicily, a church opened its doors temporarily to become a pop-up vaccination center. “For those who are Christians celebrating Easter, today means above all to be a good and honest citizens,” said the Rev. Michele Viviano, parish priest of the Salesian parish of Don Bosco in San Gregorio di Catania, Sicily. “This means also cooperating with the immunization campaign, participating in it and organizing it,” he said. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pretax-profits-big-companies-pay-us-tax-76842308,business,"NEW YORK -- Just as President Joe Biden is pushing to raise   on companies to help pay for his infrastructure plan, a report from a Washington policy group is highlighting how many firms pay zero despite making big pretax profits. More than 50 of the largest U.S. companies paid nothing in federal income   last year, with many getting rebates, even though they reported almost $40.5 billion in pretax profits as a group, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The group believes the tax system needs to raise more tax revenue. The 55 companies named in          the report issued Friday cross many industries, from agriculture to high tech, and they include such big names as Nike and Duke Energy. The report says the companies took advantage of breaks that were preserved or expanded under President  's 2017 overhaul of the tax code, as well as the economic rescue package that Washington passed last spring. Under the 2017 tax cut, the rate on corporate profits is 21%. But companies can use many tools to avoid taxes, such as writing off expenses related to the stock options they give their CEOs and other executives. Companies can also use a suite of available tax credits by making investments that the U.S. government is trying to encourage, similar to how individuals can get tax breaks for saving in a retirement fund or making their home more energy efficient. At Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest utility owners, the company recorded $110 million in tax credits last year for producing renewable energy through wind facilities, for example. That and other credits helped the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company net a $281 million rebate for federal income taxes last year, after reporting $826 million in pretax U.S. income from continuing operations. “Lawmakers developed these tax policies to encourage corporate taxpayers to make investments in economic growth, infrastructure and renewables,” Duke spokesperson Catherine Butler said. She said federal tax rules allowed Duke to delay some cash payments for taxes into the future, but not eliminate them. The company had about $9 billion in deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2020, which Butler said will become future tax payments over time. Nike, meanwhile, used a federal tax credit meant to encourage corporate research and development. The athletic apparel giant also took tax benefits related to share-based compensation for its fiscal year that ended on May 31. Altogether, it received $109 million in federal tax rebates after reporting total pretax income of $2.9 billion for the year. Officials at Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Oregon, could not be immediately reached for comment. “Most CEOs of large, publicly trade corporations are not going to risk prison to get out of paying taxes when Congress provides them with so many legal ways to do so,” said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The $2.2 trillion rescue package that Washington approved last spring to ease the pain caused by the pandemic opened more avenues for companies to limit their federal tax bills. The law allowed corporations to takes losses reported in 2018 through 2020 and use them to reduce tax liabilities from earlier years, even ones where income was taxed at higher rates. “When President Trump signaled his intention to cut corporate taxes in 2017, he and Congress had an opportunity to pare back the many loopholes that have allowed companies to avoid tax on much of their income since the early 1980s,” the authors of the report, Wamhoff and Matthew Gardner, wrote. “But now, with three years of data published on the effective tax rates paid by publicly traded companies, it is clear that the Trump law has not meaningfully curtailed corporate tax avoidance and may even be encouraging it.” Corporations altogether paid nearly $243 billion in total tax receipts in 2019, down 30% from five years earlier. One of every three corporations with more than $1 billion in assets paid zero in federal income taxes from 2013 through 2017, according to a report prepared last year by the staff of the House of Representatives’ joint committee on taxation. For smaller companies, with less than $1 billion in assets, two out of three companies have zero federal income tax liability in a given year. In 2019, corporate taxes made up 3.9% of total U.S. tax revenue, according to the Tax Foundation, a group that wants tax policies that lead to greater economic growth. That compares with an average of 9.6% across the economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That figure could rise if Biden can push through the changes to corporate taxes he's suggested to help pay for his          $2.3 trillion plan to renew the nation's infrastructure. A proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% may not make much of a difference for the companies using tax credits and other tools to avoid paying any tax. But Biden's plan to enact a 15% minimum tax on the income that corporations report to their investors, known as book income, could force some zero-tax corporations to start paying, depending on how it's done. Republicans in Congress have also already resisted corporate tax increases, saying they would hurt the U.S. economy. ——— Sweet reported from Charlotte, North Carolina."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-apologies-incorrect-tweet-denied-workers-urinate-bottles/story?id=76855171,business," apologized for an ""incorrect"" reply to a U.S. congressman's tweet last week that criticized the online shopping giant's working conditions,   that its delivery drivers may have had to urinate in bottles. The apology stems from a March 24 tweet by Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who said, ""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles."" About an hour and a half later, Amazon refuted Pocan's claim, replying in part: ""You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us."" Now, in a blog post Friday, Amazon apologized to Pocan, calling its reply an ""own-goal"" that was not properly vetted. ""It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers,"" Amazon wrote in the post. The tweet ""did not receive proper scrutiny,"" the company added. On the issue of drivers having to urinate in bottles, Amazon wrote that it knows that drivers ""can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed."" ""This is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon,"" the post continued, with links to tweets and articles about other companies reportedly facing the same problem. ""Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions."" In response to the apology, Pocan tweeted, ""Sigh."" ""This is not about me, this is about your workers -- who you don't treat with enough respect or dignity,"" he said. Pocan's initial tweet came as Amazon workers at an Alabama fulfillment center were  . Vote counting began earlier this week to determine if the workers in Bessemer will form the first-ever labor union at an Amazon warehouse in the U.S. The results for the vote have not yet come in."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/insider-qa-marcus-millichap-ceo-2021-property-market-76865155,business,"LOS ANGELES -- After a horrible 2020 that saw many tenants fall behind on rent or go belly up, commercial property landlords are seeing signs of improvement this year, including a jump in hiring by restaurants, bars and retailers. Still, the work-from-home and online shopping trends are expected to permanently reshape demand for office and retail space, says Hessam Nadji, CEO of Marcus & Millichap, a commercial real estate financing and advisory company. Nadji recently spoke to The Associated Press about the state of the commercial real estate industry and its prospects for a comeback as the economy slowly emerges from the pandemic. Q: 2020 was a rough year for commercial real estate, especially retail. How is that sector looking now? A: We’ve seen a big surge in retail related confidence, both in what landlords are reporting in rent collections as well as buyers, who are now willing to look at shopping centers they weren’t willing to look at before. So retail is seeing this more immediate kind of pop in confidence and reopening benefits, especially when it comes to restaurants, bars and entertainment. Retail is feeling the healing cycle begin and it’s very encouraging. Q: Will the surge in online shopping be a drag on retail space demand? A: The e-commerce adoption and e-commerce prevalence has permanently been boosted by the pandemic. Experiential retail -- movie theaters, fitness related retail, yoga -- those were the best performing parts of retail, pre-pandemic. And post-pandemic, experiential retail is going to have a big boost because people are tired of being at home. Where you’re really going to feel the pain are things like furniture, department stores and other commodity goods that are so much easier to obtain through e-commerce. Q: Are employers going to need less office space now that many employees have shown they can work well from home? A: Office is probably impacted on a longer-term basis more than any other property type because companies have learned you can manage a workforce remotely, and people have learned they don’t have to commute to work every single day. On both the worker side and the employer side there’s an embracing of at least a partial virtual solution to employment. Is it going to be 50-50? Is it going to be 70% in office, 30% virtual? That’s anybody’s guess. My speculation would be 70% to 80% favoring coming into the office, but 20% to 30% becoming a permanent, virtual component of how we manage ourselves and our companies. Q: How soon will we see this take shape and be reflected in vacancy rates? A: In the next four or five years as current leases roll over, that’s when that’s going to show up. I don’t think there’ll be a massive change in the dynamics of office spaces five, six years from now, but I do think there’s a permanent effect for those who lived through the pandemic and learned from it. Q: How has the pandemic affected your company? A: Commercial real estate was in great shape, pre-pandemic. So it was all about the shock the pandemic created by the occupancies, especially in retail and hotels, plummeting and therefore investors really pulling back to see how bad it was going to get. We saw confidence return fairly quickly in the third quarter of last year and then really build up to, for us, a record fourth quarter. Q: How are some of the other commercial property categories doing? A: Fundamentals are holding up very solidly in self-storage. There’s strength in the industrial market, because of the modern warehouse distribution needs that major online retailers have and a lot of the old industrial product became functionally obsolete. So, there’s been a lot of new building that’s being absorbed very rapidly. Industrial vacancies are very low and rent growth is very high, despite the fact that we’ve built a record amount of new business in industrial. We’re seeing the most pain of course in hotels, shopping centers. Senior housing is going to take a while to recover as well, because of all the health issues and concerns people have putting their elderly parents now in care facilities. Q: Do you expect the outlook for commercial real estate to improve now that the economy is reopening? A: I’m fairly confident that unless there are additional waves or bad experiences that really take the wind out of the vaccination and normalization of the economy, improvement is not only going to continue it’s going to gain a lot of steam as we go into the second half of the year. ——— Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/facebook-data-500m-accounts-found-online-76858417,business,"NEW YORK -- Details from more than 500 million   users have been found available on a website for hackers. The information appears to be several years old, but it is another example of the vast amount of information collected by   and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is. The availability of the data set was first reported by Business Insider. According to that publication, it has information from 106 countries including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, and email addresses. Facebook has been grappling with data security issues for years. In 2018, the social media giant disabled a feature that allowed users to search for one another via phone number following revelations that the political firm   had accessed information on up to 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge or consent. In December 2019, a         Ukrainian security researcher reported finding a database  with the names, phone numbers and unique user IDs of more than 267 million Facebook users — nearly all U.S.-based — on the open internet. It is unclear if the current data dump is related to this database. “This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019,"" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement. “We found and fixed this issue in August 2019.”"

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/delta-cancels-100-flights-opens-middle-seats-76871627,business,"DETROIT -- Delta Air Lines canceled about 100 flights Sunday due to staff shortages, and it opened up middle seats a month earlier than expected in order to carry more passengers. The airline says it had over 1 million passengers during the past few days, the highest number since before the   pandemic began last year. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience, and the majority have been rebooked for the same travel day,” the airline said Sunday in a statement. Delta took steps to increase passenger capacity, including opening middle seats on Sunday and Monday, in an effort to accommodate passengers. On Wednesday, the airline announced that it would stop blocking off middle seats starting in May. The move was made last April to keep passengers farther apart, a policy that Delta's CEO had repeatedly cited as raising trust in the airline. The seats would be reopened as air travel recovers and more people become vaccinated against COVID-19, the airline said. Delta said the middle seats were opened just for Sunday and Monday, and its seat-blocking policy has not changed. Where needed, seats could be unblocked in order to get customers to their destinations on the same day. “Delta teams have been working through various factors, including staffing, large numbers of employee vaccinations and pilots returning to active status,"" the airline said in the statement. Some employees were having adverse side effects from being vaccinated. On Sunday, websites at three Delta hubs showed 33 canceled arriving or departing flights. There were 19 at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, another 11 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and three more at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport. Delta said Wednesday that nearly 65% of people who flew on Delta last year expect to have at least one dose of the new   by May 1. That gave Delta the assurance to end seating limits, it said. The airline industry was divided over the utility of blocking middle seats to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 on a flight. Airlines including Delta, Southwest, Alaska and JetBlue limited seating for months, while United Airlines never did and American did so only briefly. Social-distancing is hard if not impossible on an airplane, even with middle seats empty — a point that United CEO Scott Kirby made many times to explain his airline’s resistance to seat-blocking. Air travel in the United States is recovering from pandemic lows. More than 1 million travelers have gone through U.S. airports for each of the last 20 days, although March traffic remains down nearly half from the same month in 2019. The numbers are rising heading into the crucial summer vacation season. Last summer was a catastrophe for the  , contributing to Delta’s full-year loss of more than $12 billion.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/italy-enters-day-easter-lockdown-amid-vaccination-snags-76855618,business,"ROME -- Italy entered a three-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown Saturday to deter Easter travel and get-togethers even as the country's variant-fueled spike in new infections began to wane. The government had announced last month that it would place all regions into the strictest “red zone” lockdown over the Easter weekend to limit the chances of contagion, taking the same precautions it enforced over Christmas and New Year’s. Travel between regions and visits to relatives were being limited through Monday. Nonessential shops were closed and restaurants and bars were only open for take-out. “People are tired, but they are aware that protecting health is essential in these times,” said Maj. Fabio Palletta, a Carabinieri military police officer manning a checkpoint in Rome on Saturday, one of many set up around the country this weekend to ensure people on the roads were authorized to travel. The Interior Ministry also ordered up extra foot police patrols to break up large gatherings in squares and parks, which over Easter are usually packed with picnic-goers. “I’m glad they are doing checks. It means something is working in this whole mess,” said Amato Monatanari, who was pulled over for a check in Rome. Italy, where Europe's outbreak began, has recorded more than 110,000 COVID-19 dead, more than any other European country but Britain. Another 21,000 infections were reported Saturday in  , along with 376 dead. An estimated 87% of  ’s newest cases have been traced to the highly contagious variant first detected in Britain. But the Health Ministry reported Friday that for the second week in a row, new cases had “slightly diminished.” But because Italian hospitals in most regions are still well over their COVID-19 capacity in both intensive care units and other wards, the ministry concluded that new infections were still “too high ... to allow any reduction in current restrictive measures.” Italians, however, are upset over the country's stumbling vaccination campaign, which despite having promised to prioritize older people has left          many of Italy's eldest, most vulnerable people behind while teachers, police officers and other professional workers get their jabs. The Lombardy region, Italy’s biggest, has          suffered more COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other but still has had a faltering vaccination campaign, earning a personal visit this week from Italy’s new virus czar, Gen. Francesco Figliuolo. “There are things that aren’t going well,” Figliuolo said. “We’ll note them, and then we’ll fix them together.” More than three months into Italy’s nationwide vaccination campaign, Lombardy this week opened a new centralized appointment portal after its previous system sent some elderly people hundreds of kilometers (miles) from home to get a jab and left others unable to get an appointment. Lombardy’s embattled regional governor, Attilio Fontana, acknowledged “some difficulties” but insisted that they hadn’t impacted the overall vaccination campaign. He said the criticism of the regional effort was “nauseating.” Italy has administered 10.8 million   nationwide, though only 3.3 million of the country’s 60 million people have received both doses. Lombardy, which counts one sixth of the population and has long prided itself on its health care system, has administered 1.7 million doses. On Saturday in Sicily, a church opened its doors temporarily to become a pop-up vaccination center. “For those who are Christians celebrating Easter, today means above all to be a good and honest citizens,” said the Rev. Michele Viviano, parish priest of the Salesian parish of Don Bosco in San Gregorio di Catania, Sicily. “This means also cooperating with the immunization campaign, participating in it and organizing it,” he said. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dc-buttigieg-build-bridges-biden-plan-76864685,business,"WASHINGTON -- Pete Buttigieg was a few weeks into his job as   secretary, buried in meetings and preparing for the launch of President  ’s $2.3 trillion public works plan, when evening arrived along with a time to try something new in Washington. Instead of climbing into the back seat of a black SUV like most Cabinet secretaries, he headed to a bike-share rack. Helmet on, and with a couple of Secret Service agents flanking him, he pedaled the mile-long trip to his home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. It wasn't a one-time stunt. On Thursday, Buttigieg arrived at the White House for a Cabinet meeting on his two-wheeler. And that wasn't his only “regular guy” moment. Dog park devotees in the District of Columbia have also seen him there, chatting up anyone from children to members of Congress such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Buttigieg first had his eye on the job of the man who is now his boss, Biden.         Buttigieg's presidential campaign was surprisingly successful — he essentially tied for first with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses and finished a close second to him in the New Hampshire primary — and he made a strong impression as someone who represented the future of the Democratic Party. Now the man known during his campaign as “Mayor Pete"" — he was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana — faces the first test of that potential in his first job in Washington: leading a Cabinet department with a $75 billion annual budget and a mandate to help spur an infrastructure program that Biden has likened to the the building of the interstate highway system in the 1950s. He will have to navigate the complicated politics of both an entrenched bureaucracy at the Transportation Department and the fraught politics of a bitterly divided Washington. He may have found a way by just riding a bike, which has gained fans from even skeptics in Congress. “You've got to keep your head up,” Buttigieg told The Associated Press, explaining the path and potential dangers posed from unaccustomed drivers, but he said it can be a much quicker journey from point A to B. Biden on Thursday tasked Buttigieg and four other Cabinet members — the “Jobs Cabinet” — with selling the administration's infrastructure and climate plan, a flood of money for roads, bridges, airports, broadband communications, water systems and electric cars. But the plan has already hit a wall with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who objects to the corporate tax increases Biden says will pay for the plan and pledges to oppose it “every step of the way.” On the other side, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, says the package should be significantly larger. Daunting as it may seem, the challenge of helping build consensus fits the ambition of the man who had the audacity to run for president from the perch of being mayor of a midsize town in Indiana. When Biden selected the smooth-talking Naval reserve veteran for the   post, he praised him as offering “a new voice with new ideas determined to move past old politics.” In an interview, Buttigieg said he believes that bipartisan consensus is attainable. Joining Buttigieg in selling the plan are Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “I’ve had enough conversations, especially the one-on-one conversations away from the cameras with members from both sides of the aisle, to know there really is a sincere interest in getting this done,” Buttigieg told the AP. “Now politics can get in the way of that of course. But I think unlike a lot of other issues where there is just deep passionately felt profound disagreement about what to do, here there’s a really healthy overlap in terms of our ideas about what has to happen, even if there is a lot of difference on how to get there.” Translation? Republicans like smooth roads and fast internet for their constituents, too. But so far, there is no indication Republicans share his position. The proposal offers big stakes for Buttigieg at the department, where he pledges to promote public transit and other green alternatives to gas-guzzling cars and apply an “equity lens” to infrastructure projects. “Black and brown neighborhoods have been disproportionately divided by highway projects or left isolated by the lack of adequate transit and transportation resources,” Buttigieg tweeted in December. Under Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, he said, ""we will make righting these wrongs an imperative.” Just two months into the job, Buttigieg has met with two dozen House members and 13 senators and in recent days has upped that pace, talking to lawmakers both parties every day. Republicans describe the former McKinsey consultant as likable and open-minded, even if they wonder at times about his actual level of sway on legislation. Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on a key panel overseeing highways, said he’s talked with Buttigieg twice, once at a meeting with Biden and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. He called the conversations “really good.” “I’m very excited to be able to work with him,” said Davis, a cyclist back home in his rural district, who thinks the former mayor can bring a valuable street-level perspective to filling potholes and easing congested streets. “If he wants to go for a ride to discuss bike lanes and public transit, I’d welcome that,” he said. Though the youngest Cabinet member at age 39, Buttigieg possesses a star power matched by few others in the group. He's displayed an ability to command media attention and use those moments — including during a series of memorable Fox News hits around the election — to sway the public, including those not always apt to vote Democratic. He’s spoken at the popular SXSW conference in Texas, joined Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va., to promote expanded passenger rail, and tweets at a frequency to a wider public that comes close to rivaling Donald Trump when he was president. Buttigieg promotes transit policy both on his official and personal account, where he also expresses devotion to his husband, Chasten. Buttigieg, who owns two dogs, has even been seen at a neighborhood park with Ocasio-Cortez. A chance meeting, he said. The new transportation secretary had one recent stumble: He had to quickly walk back a plan to charge drivers per mile they drove. It's a proposal that has some support among Republicans but could violate Biden's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000. Buttigieg has impressed West Wing aides with his work ethic and willingness to learn, and he was quickly granted approval to pursue a robust engagement with the media. The president’s advisers also hold warm feelings toward the former mayor for his decision last spring to quickly endorse Biden after abandoning his own campaign, helping accelerate the end of the Democratic primary contest. And Biden has compared Buttigieg to his late son Beau, a powerful evocation that helped cement his importance to the president. Now bound to Biden’s agenda and performance, Buttigieg begins a phase likely to enhance his public service portfolio — and life experience. This phase accomplishes what some allies have said Buttigieg needed, a next chapter, beyond the underdog story of the boy wonder from the small Midwestern city. Friends and advisers had long suggested that he get out of South Bend and see more of the world than his seven-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 allowed. Buttigieg was also busy taking steps toward running for president when he got married in June 2018 and when his father died six months later. During the campaign, he said he and Chasten had hopes of becoming parents. Asked about his desire to be a father, Buttigieg told the AP “we’re still working at that,” before adding with a smile, “Stay tuned.” As quickly as he rose, Buttigieg swiftly suspended his campaign in March 2020, before Biden's ascension in the primary was clear. He knew when to get out. He'll probably know when to get back in, too, if he does. “He has incredible political talent and skill,” said Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a longtime friend and 2020 campaign supporter. “But part of that talent and skill is having really great political timing.” On that front, she sees his work on infrastructure not as ""part of this grand plan on his next move,” but rather as a demonstration of his ability to focus on the task at hand. Buttigieg and his husband have been spotted walking around their new neighborhood, Capitol Hill, where they live in a one-bedroom apartment, meandering the artisanal stalls at Eastern Market to smiles from residents. Last weekend, they wandered along the brick row houses and blooming magnolia cherry blossom trees, greeting neighbors with waves and allowing young children to pet their dogs. Their one-eyed puggle named “Buddy,” adopted in late 2018, has become something of an Instagram star. Buddy lingered as a blond-haired little girl ran up and sat to snuggle him while the other lab mix, Truman, stood nearby. “He loves the attention,” Chasten Buttigieg explained to the girl, a trait Buddy picked up during the campaign. Pete Buttigieg smiled as the girl gave the dog a goodbye scratch on the head, and the couple slowly made the way back on a path toward the Capitol. ——— Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stores-greece-open-amid-virus-surge-save-economy-76877543,business,"ATHENS, Greece -- Retail stores across most of Greece were allowed to reopen Monday despite an ongoing surge in COVID-19 infections, as the country battles to emerge from deep recession. Stores in greater Athens opened for pickup services only but remain closed in Greece's second- and third-largest cities, Thessaloniki and Patras, because of fears of a more serious spike in infections. Lockdown measures have been in force since early November, although shops opened briefly around the Christmas holiday season. The prolonged closures piled pressure on the economy. Greek economic output shrank by 8.2% in 2020 while the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product shot over 200%. About 16% of the country’s residents have received at least one dose of the   vaccination but infection rates continue to rise. “Opening retail businesses ... will provide a decompression valve for our society and will help improve the implementation of (restrictive) measures,” government spokeswoman Aristoltelia Peloni said. The center-right government has pinned its reopening policy on the mass distribution of test kits that will be provided for free on a weekly basis to help reopen schools, expected later this month, and the country’s vital tourism industry in mid-May. In Thessaloniki, in northern Greece, protesting store owners hung black banners outside business entrances, angry that they weren't allowed to reopen. Others opened their stores but didn't serve customers, in an act of defiance. The head of the city's chamber of commerce, Michalis Zorpidis, told the AP that it was taking the government to the country's highest administrative court. “We feel that the decision is unfair and illegal. That's why we took legal actions against the government to reverse the decision,” Zorpidis said. The daily number of confirmed infections nationwide — a statistic affected by testing levels — reached the highest rate since the start of the pandemic in Greece at 28.5 per 100,000 residents as a seven-day rolling average.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-eyes-testing-covid-19-passports-mass-gatherings-76865628,business,"LONDON -- Britain is planning to test a series of measures including “coronavirus status certifications"" over the coming weeks to see if they can allow people to safely return to mass gatherings at sports arenas, nightclubs and concerts. People attending a range of events this month and in May, including a club night and key FA Cup soccer matches, will need to be tested both before and after. The trials will also gather evidence on how ventilation and different approaches to social distancing could enable large events to go ahead. Officials are also developing plans to test out COVID-19 passports that are expected to show if a person has received a vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has some immunity due to having had   in the previous six months. The issue of vaccine passports has been a hotly debated topic around the world, including in the United States and Israel. The question is how much governments, employers, venues and other places have a right to know about a person's virus status. Many disagree over what the right balance is between a person's right to medical privacy and the collective right of people in groups not to be infected with a dangerous disease by others. Some critics also say such vaccine passports will enable discrimination against poor people and impoverished nations that do not have ready access to vaccines. Authorities in Britain have said the passes could involve the use of an app or paper certificates for those who don't have access to the digital option. But U.K. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston stressed to reporters that “the earliest pilots almost certainly won't involve any elements of certification” but will involve testing before and after the events. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details about the coronavirus passports on Monday. “We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country so people can return to the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible, and these reviews will play an important role in allowing this to happen,” Johnson said. Dozens of British lawmakers, including some from Johnson’s own Conservative Party, have opposed the plans. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who has led the task force responsible for drawing up the plans, acknowledged that vaccine passports raised “a host of practical and ethical questions” which needed to be resolved before any wider rollout. Officials said the trial events include the FA Cup semi-final at London's Wembley Stadium later this month with a crowd of 4,000 in a stadium that seats 90,000, and the event's final on May 15, with a crowd of 21,000. Other upcoming trial events include the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, central England; a club night at a warehouse and a comedy club event in Liverpool; and three marathon races involving thousands of runners. The news about the trials came as U.K. businesses including pubs, restaurants, nonessential shops and hairdressers prepared to welcome back customers as restrictions ease in England. Officials say 47% of the country’s population has had a first vaccine dose and more than 5 million people in the U.K. have received their second shot. Johnson’s government is also expected to set out its approach to easing restrictions on international travel next week. Media reports say when Britain's current ban on foreign holidays is lifted, a risk-based traffic light system with ratings for countries around the world will be introduced and travellers will be required to quarantine accordingly. More details are to be unveiled when a government task force on global travel reports on April 12. The government has said that international vacation travel cannot take place until mid-May at the earliest. Last week the U.K. added four more nations to its red list of countries from which travel is banned except for U.K. citizens and those with residency rights. By April 9, the U.K. red list will be up to 39 countries. It aims to prevent more virus variants — especially ones first detected in Brazil and South Africa — from getting into the U.K. Despite Britain's success on the vaccination front, it still has the highest reported COVID-19 death toll in Europe at around 127,000 deaths. Infections have come down significantly in Britain. The government on Sunday reported only 2,297 confirmed new daily cases and 10 additional deaths. That compares to nearly 70,000 daily new cases and up to 1,800 daily COVID-19 deaths in January. The latest figures were likely lower than expected because of a lag in reporting over the Easter weekend. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine  and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/sharon-cohen-honored-ap-national-writer-dead-68-76878562,business,"Sharon Cohen, a matchless reporter who told American stories with great skill and compassion over more than four decades at The Associated Press, died Monday at her Chicago home. She was 68. At her death, more than a year after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Cohen was a national writer, a prestigious position she had held for 20 years. From her base in Chicago, she unreeled an array of stories about the triumphs and tragedies of people both ordinary and extraordinary. There was the story of         Vashti Risdall, the foster mother of 162 children who retired at age 96 only because her 74-year-old daughter insisted. Of Marine Sgt.         Merlin German, the “Miracle Man” who survived a bomb blast in  , dancing with his mom after 100 surgeries. Of barber         Gilbert Peppin, who lived under a shadow for 30 years, unjustly suspected of his wife’s murder. Every story got the Sharon Cohen treatment: determined reporting, zealous fact-checking, direct and evocative writing. She knew no other way. “Sharon’s genius was in capturing the stories of Americans as they lived out the intense changes and disruptions of the last 40 years — struggling when their town’s factory closed, trying to pull away from drugs or violence, bewildered when they came back from war,"" said Sally Buzbee, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor. ""Her stories often made me cry. They always opened our minds. As a reporter and writer, she was a dream — both utterly precise and dogged and also hugely compassionate.” Cohen was an idea machine, never comfortable unless she had one story she was working on, another on deck and others in line. In the days before the internet, when she was a regional reporter covering the Midwest, Cohen subscribed to a score of small newspapers; she was always looking for that three-paragraph brief on page 38 that might turn into something special. She gathered far more research than she could ever use, filling file cabinets throughout the Chicago bureau. “You know the iceberg principle of writing, where most of the writer’s research and knowledge is below the surface?” said former AP editor John Dowling, a longtime friend and colleague. “The bottom of Sharon’s story-iceberg was more like an Antarctic ice shelf.” She wrote just about every kind of story imaginable in the course of her career, but patterns emerged. She wrote true crime stories -- a ring that used         babies to smuggle drugs, for example -- but also larger pieces about         women jailed because of opioids, about         juveniles in prison, about the failure to investigate         the disappearances of Native American women. She wrote about American workers:         struggling farms, the lives of         meatpackers  100 years after Upton Sinclair wrote “The Jungle,”         auto workers forced to commute 500 miles to new jobs when their plants closed. She wrote about America’s fighting men and women. In 2008, she told the story of         “The Long Haul” -- a 15,000-word, seven-part serial that won smashing front-page displays in newspapers across the country. “This is the story,” she wrote, “of a very long deployment of a very long war, of how members of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division lived and died in  , how their families endured while they were gone, and how what happened in a far distant land still resonates today.” And she wrote about her native city. Cohen was a devoted daughter of Chicago. She never left it, aside from attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She worked for community newspapers, the suburban edition of the Chicago Tribune and United Press International before joining the AP in 1979. She knew Chicago’s history and its neighborhoods, loved its rambunctious politics, railed against its corruption and greatly admired its hard-working people. She also felt that it was too often stereotyped. And so she wrote about         Urban Prep, an inner-city school that had the audacious goal of sending every member of the Class of 2010 to college -- and succeeded. And one of her final stories, published last fall, was about         Auburn Gresham, a Black neighborhood where people found hope despite their struggles with COVID-19, violent protests, gun violence and economic misery. “I’ve tried to explain and capture the lives and voices of people who aren’t in the headlines every day, because I think those are the most powerful stories,” she said in 2015 upon receiving a Studs Terkel Community Media Award for her life’s work. Cohen received many other prizes, including the AP’s Gramling Journalism Award in 1999. She won countless Peter Lisagor Awards from the Chicago Headline Club; no one knows just how many. Little wonder that some colleagues called her “the Queen,” according to AP National Writer Martha Irvine. Cohen was intense, and intensely private. For a long time, Irvine found this diminutive woman -- who always wore high heels, even while reporting in the oil fields of North Dakota -- hard to befriend. “Then on one of our trips ... she walked down the aisle of the plane, dropped a chocolate bar on my tray and grinned ever so slightly as she continued on,” Irvine recalled. “I’d finally made it.” Chocolate was not necessarily the most prominent of Cohen’s passions -- she loved to travel, she was an avid reader, she enjoyed photography and was good at it. But this notoriously finicky eater’s love of chocolate and other sweets endured nearly to her life’s end, said Mike Robinson, a former AP staffer who was her partner for 40 years. (He survives her, as does her brother, Marshall Cohen of Chicago, and his wife and two children. She was predeceased by her parents, David and Esther.) As recently as January, Robinson said, she ordered babkas from two Jewish bakeries in Brooklyn. It was a sort of experiment, to see which one was best. Both were delicious; it was too difficult to decide. So they ate them both."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/malaysian-pm-najib-appeals-graft-conviction-1mdb-saga-76872986,business,"PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia -- A Malaysian court on Monday began hearing an appeal by ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak to overturn his conviction and 12-year jail sentence linked to the massive looting of the 1MDB state investment fund that brought down his government in 2018. The appeal came more than eight months after a high court found Najib guilty of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering, making him the first Malaysian leader to be convicted. He has said he was misled by rogue bankers and that the case against him is political. The ruling was part of the first of several corruption trials against Najib that are linked to the 1MDB scandal, which sparked investigations in the U.S. and several other countries. U.S. investigators alleged that over $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB and laundered by Najib's associates. Najib, 67, arrived at the Court of Appeal early Monday but didn't speak to reporters. Najib, who set up 1MDB shortly after taking office in 2009, has denied all wrongdoing and his sentence was stayed pending the appeal. Defense lawyers say Najib has been denied a fair trial. One of his lawyers, Farhan Read, told The Associated Press that the high court judge made “serious misdirections"" in the trial. Najib's defense team earlier sought a one-month postponement to give it more time to obtain documentary evidence but the three-member appellate bench rejected the application. Last July, Najib made brief remarks under oath before his sentencing, saying he wasn’t aware of the 42 million ringgit ($10 million) channeled into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit. But the judge ruled that Najib's argument that he was duped by Malaysian fugitive financier Low Taek Jho into believing the money was part of a donation by the Saudi royal family, to keep Najib from being suspicious of 1MDB plundering, was far-fetched and a weak fabrication. Investigators have identified Low as the mastermind behind the looting of 1MDB and he remains at large. Najib’s second and third trials involving some of the remaining charges are ongoing. His wife and several officials from his party and previous government have also been charged with graft related to 1MDB corruption."

The board's special committee said in a prepared statement that its decision lets Tribune “engage in discussions and negotiations with, and provide diligence information to Newslight,"" which is Bainum and Wyss' group. But for now it continues to recommend that shareholders choose Alden's offer. Tribune Publishing Co. said it got a non-binding proposal from Newslight on Thursday, an offer of $18.50 per share that was fully financed by equity from Bainum and Wyss. The Newslight offer emerged after pushback from journalists at many of Tribune's paper against the Alden deal. Alden, one of the country's largest newspaper publishers, has a reputation for cutting costs and jobs in an industry already hollowed out by newsroom layoffs. Alden currently owns nearly one-third of Tribune's shares. A representative for Alden declined to comment Monday.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-mixed-wall-st-record-amid-vaccine-optimism-76874265,business,"BEIJING -- Stocks rose broadly in afternoon trading on Wall Street Monday as the economy showed more signs that it's continuing to recover. The U.S. government reported last week that employers went on a         hiring spree in March, adding 916,000 jobs, the most since August. Investors had a delayed reaction to the encouraging job growth, which was released on Friday when stock trading was closed. Investors were further encouraged by a report Monday showing that the         services sector recorded record growth in March as orders, hiring and prices surged. The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and is on track to beat the record high it set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 403 points, or 1.2%, to 33,557 and the Nasdaq rose 1.4% as of 12:17 p.m. Eastern. Both employment and the services industry have been lagging other areas of the economy throughout the recovery. Analysts have said that both need to show signs of growth in order for the recovery to remain on track. COVID-19 and the potential for a spike in cases remains a concern, but the strong rollout of vaccinations is making an eventual return to normal for many people seem clearer and closer. Tesla also surprised investors with a report that         vehicle deliveries doubled during the first quarter. Technology stocks were the biggest gainers. Apple rose 2.1% and Microsoft gained 2.8%. Tesla rose 5% following its encouraging report on vehicle deliveries. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.70% from 1.72% last last week. The gains were broad, with nearly every sector rising. Companies that stand to benefit from a broader reopening of the economy and economic growth also did well. Norwegian Cruise Line rose 5.9% as it seeks permission to restart cruises out of U.S. ports in July with a vaccination requirement for passengers and crew members. Rival Carnival rose 4.3% and Royal Caribbean gained 3.5%. Energy companies lagged the broader market as crude oil prices slipped 3.8%. Marathon Oil fell 4.5%.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/businesses-masks-states-drop-mandates-76879037,business,"NEW YORK -- Although Texas no longer requires people to wear masks to protect against COVID-19, customers do need them to enter De J. Lozada’s store. “We cannot afford to take chances with the lives of my staffers. They’re young people and their parents have entrusted me with their care,” says Lozada, owner of Soul Popped Gourmet Popcorn, a shop located in Austin’s Barton Creek Square Mall. Lozada is also concerned about her 85-year-old father, who will return to his part-time job in the store this month. She has a staffer stationed at the door to her shop who will tell anyone without a mask that they cannot enter. Eighteen states currently have no mask requirements, including some that have never made face coverings mandatory. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott lifted his state’s mask mandate on March 2, and Indiana expects to end its mandate on Tuesday. But many business owners like Lozada are keeping their own rules in place, requiring staffers and customers alike to wear masks for the sake of protecting everybody, particularly their employees. And the law is on an owner’s side. A company’s premises are private property, so owners can insist that customers wear masks, just as restaurants can require that diners wear shoes and shirts in order to be served, says Michael Jones, an attorney with the law firm Eckert Seamans in Philadelphia. “Storeowners, business owners have the absolute right to require customers, vendors, anyone who comes onto their property to wear a mask,” Jones says. It’s legal as long as owners don’t enforce their requirements in a discriminatory way, he says. If a customer enters a store without a mask, is asked to leave and doesn’t, that could be trespassing under the law. Lozada says she would call 911 if faced with that situation. Most retail chains require employees and customers to wear masks. One exception, Foot Locker, says each store is following the requirements of the state where it's located. Employers have an obligation under federal law and some state laws to provide a safe workplace for their employees, and that can include requiring everyone on the premises to wear masks. In the COVID-19 section of its website, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration notes that employers are required to have a workplace “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.” When employees at Inteplast Group question why they have to wear masks, managers at the plastic products manufacturer can point to the law, says Brenda Wilson, senior director of human resources and communications of the Livingston, New Jersey-based company that has facilities in 22 states. At this point, masks to protect against COVID-19 are as important as the eye and ear protection that factory workers must wear. But she says Inteplast’s customers also need to be protected. “They are depending on us to get the products out. If we have an outbreak and that results in losing manufacturing capacity, then no one’s going to win,” Wilson says. Many employees want their bosses to require masks. The 16 massage therapists who work for Amber Briggle cannot maintain the recommended six-foot distance from their clients and still do their work. She requires masks for everyone at her two Soma Massage locations in Denton, Texas. She told her customers in a blog post, “these same masks have kept all of us healthy since we reopened in May — we haven’t had a single COVID case transmitted here despite the thousands of people we’ve seen.” When some clients objected, saying they wanted to be more comfortable and weren’t worried about safety, Briggle has stood firm. “I’ve told them, ‘you can put your mask on or you can leave.’ And they’d leave. We’d offer them a mask, and they’d leave,” she says. But requiring masks has brought Briggle new customers, including some who canceled memberships at spas where masks are not required. Even with masks, Briggle and her staff have had three COVID-19 scares, when clients called after appointments to say they’d tested positive for the virus. The three therapists were taken off the schedule and their clients were notified. Neither the therapists nor their clients tested positive. But some owners don’t want their customers or clients to feel uncomfortable. When clients at Vanessa Perry’s Houston-based credit counseling service ask if they can take off their masks, she says OK. “We are keeping our distance and letting our clients do what makes them comfortable,” says Perry, owner of Impeccable Credit Services. Perry and her staffers remain masked. Perry did research before deciding on her mask-optional policy for clients. The increasing numbers of vaccinated people in Houston, and the fact that the majority of Perry’s clients are seen online, have convinced her that the chances of a client spreading the virus are diminishing. But when a prospective client comes to Justin Hill’s San Antonio, Texas, law office without a mask, Hill takes them out on the patio for their conversation. He often finds that when he and a would-be client disagree about masks, it’s a sign that they might not work well together on a case. “Some of them, we’ve realized might not have been the perfect fit,” says Hill, whose practice specializes in personal injury cases."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ism-survey-us-services-surge-record-high-march-76878935,business,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. services sector, which employs most Americans, recorded record growth in March as the easing of   restrictions released pent-up consumer demand. The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported Monday that its nonmanufacturing index rose to an all-time high 63.7 last month from 55.3 in February. The old record of 60.9 was set in October 2018. New orders also hit a record, and hiring and prices grew faster. Anything above 50 signals growth, and the services sector is on a 10-month winning streak since rebounding from the economic impact of the pandemic last spring. The March reading was much higher than economists had expected. The rollout of   is encouraging Americans to return to normal life — shopping and eating out — and President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan is also likely to stimulate demand for services and juice economic growth. “All the right pieces for a faster services recovery – expanded vaccine eligibility, reopenings, and historic fiscal expansion – are falling into place,'' economists Oren Klachkin and Gregory Daco of Oxford Econmics wrote in a research note. Although debate on economic policy often focuses on manufacturing, services — such as banks, retailers and restaurants — account for 71% of all U.S. jobs and 83% of private jobs."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bidens-big-infrastructure-plan-hits-mcconnell-gop-blockade-76873708,business,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are making the politically brazen bet that it’s more advantageous to oppose President  ’s ambitious “         Rebuild America” agenda  than to lend support for the costly $2.3 trillion undertaking for roads, bridges and other infrastructure investments. Much the way Republicans provided no votes for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, they plan to stay on the sidelines for this next big lift by the White House, forcing Democrats to take full ownership of the massive package of spending and corporate tax hikes that Biden wants approved over the summer. Both sides are digging in this week as Biden shows no signs adjusting to satisfy Republican leaders, instead appealing directly to their constituents. ""They know we need it,” Biden said of the Republicans Monday as he returned to Washington. The president did not close the door on negotiations but vowed to “push as hard as I can"" for the plan. ""Everybody around the world is investing billions and billions of dollars in infrastructure, and we’re going to do it here,” he said. That leaves Biden and congressional Republicans on a collision course, the outcome of which could define the parties and his presidency. The GOP strategy is reminiscent of their Obama-era stance that helped sour voters on the Democratic president and his Congress more than a decade ago. Then and now Republicans are intent on saddling Democrats with responsibility for all the   and spending to come, much as they did the 2009 rescue after the economic crisis, framing it as government overreach that piles on debt. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declared plainly on Monday that Biden's plan is “something we’re not going to do.” Speaking to reporters in Kentucky, McConnell said Republicans could support a “much more modest” approach, and one that doesn't rely on corporate tax hikes to pay for it. But it’s not at all certain the GOP playbook that worked more than a decade ago will produce the same political gains this time around. Voters appear tired of the partisan stalemate in Washington. Many live in the country's run-down areas and are signaling they are initially supportive of Biden’s approach to governing, at least on the virus aid package. Recent         polling  by The Associated Press-NORC Public Research Center found Americans have responded favorably to the president’s approach, with 73% approving of his handling of the pandemic. That includes about half of Republicans. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of Senate GOP leadership, said Sunday a smaller infrastructure package of about $615 billion, or 30% of what Biden is proposing, could find bipartisan backing from Republicans if the White House did way with the new tax and relied on user fees or other ways to pay for the spending. Under the Biden plan, the corporate tax rate would rise back to 28% — not fully reversing the Trump-era GOP tax cut on big business but settling on a middle ground from what had been a 35% rate before Republicans approved the 2017 tax overhaul. It's now at 21%, Rather than shy from a new era of bigger government, Democratic leaders in Congress are embracing it, believing they can bypass the GOP blockade on Capitol Hill and make the case directly to Americans hungry for investments in homes, communities and livelihoods, especially as China and other rival countries make advancements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi compares         Biden’s plan to the far-reaching aims of presidents before him — from Thomas Jefferson’s efforts to build the Erie Canal to Teddy Roosevelt's designs on a national park system. Progressives want Biden to go even bigger. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Sunday he expects more funding to combat climate change and is pushing to include his own proposal to expand Medicare with dental, vision and hearing aid care for seniors. As Congress hunkers down to begin drafting the legislation for Biden's proposal, both parties will be put the test. In the House, lawmakers will be invited to submit requests for projects in their home districts — roads and other infrastructure that could be “earmarks” eligible for federal funds. It's a way to entice bipartisan participation and ensure the funds are spent on agreed-upon needs. Republicans will be forced to either participate or disengage, often with pressure from elected officials and other constituents clamoring for funds to upgrade sewers, airports and countless other infrastructure systems. Peppered with questions as he toured Kentucky about money that could be potentially flowing for home-state road, bridge and housing projects, McConnell has batted them back one by one. McConnell vowed last week to fight Biden’s agenda “every step of the way.” Asked about that comment, Biden told reporters Friday, “I think the Republicans’ voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done."" At the same time, Democrats as well as Republicans will be faced with the politically sticky vote on raising corporate   to pay for all the spending, bucking the business community that is largely against Biden's plan to permanently hike the rate corporations pay to 28%. Both parties view it as an almost existential battle over competing political views: The Democrats who believe in the power of government to take the lead solving the nation's problems; the Republicans who put their faith in the private sector to drive solutions. On Capitol Hill, it's also a battle over which party will control Congress. After Barack Obama was elected in 2008, McConnell famously said his goal was to make the Democrat a one-term president. This time around the Republican leader appears to have a shorter-term goal at hand — he wants to win back the now evenly split 50-50 Senate. “They’re so close to the majority in 2022, they can taste it,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. Democrats have Senate control because their party’s vice president, Kamala Harris, can cast a tie-breaking vote. In the House, the Democratic majority is holding on by just a handful of seats. Conant said the Republicans: “They really don’t want to give Biden wins,."" Democrats, uncertain about their political prospects, are legislating as if they are on borrowed time. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has set in motion a potential process that would allow Biden's package to advance without the typical 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster by Republicans. Instead, it could be approved with a simple 51-vote majority. Pelosi has set a July 4 goal for House votes, but acknowledges that ambitious timeline may slip. ——— Associated Press writer Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/billionaires-john-laura-arnold-give-wealth-yearly-76881769,business,"Billionaire philanthropists John and Laura Arnold have committed to donate 5% of their wealth annually as part of an effort to encourage increased, timelier donations to charities. The Arnolds, who live in Houston, are the first billionaires to sign on to the advocacy organization Global Citizen's “Give While You Live” campaign, which calls on the world’s billionaires to give at least 5% of their wealth every year to a cause. The Arnolds' pledge Monday came as part of an alliance between Global Citizen and the Arnold-led Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving — a coalition of donors and experts who want Congress to raise giving requirements. By agreeing to give 5%, the Arnolds are voluntarily subjecting their assets to the same minimum payment standard private foundations must donate annually to maintain their tax-exempt status. But there’s been an         ongoing debate during the coronavirus pandemic on whether foundations and donor advised funds -- similar to charitable investment accounts — should be required to give more because of increased needs. “Right now, many charities are in danger of not surviving the pandemic. Yet, more than $1 trillion promised to them remains warehoused in tax-free investment accounts,” John Arnold, the former hedge fund executive turned philanthropist, said in the announcement. “America’s charities cannot afford to wait for some larger crisis to arise. Business as usual is simply not good enough.” Donor-advised funds aren't required to make donations in any given year -- a hot-button issue in philanthropy since donors are able to take immediate tax deductions before charities get any of the money. The Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving has been calling for these assets to be donated within 15 years. But this, and its other         calls for reforming tax benefits for donors, have gotten pushback from groups opposing more government involvement in giving. “Some donor-advised funds, emulating the Arnolds’ example, are committed to timely and ongoing distribution of their resources. But others are not,” said Edward A. Zelinsky, a tax law professor at Yeshiva University’s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. “For some, the Arnolds’ example may now be instructive, but I unfortunately do not believe that their example will be followed by all,"" he added. The latest pledge is not the first giving commitment made by the Arnolds. They’ve already signed the Giving Pledge, a commitment developed by Bill Gates, his wife Melinda, and Warren Buffett to get the world’s richest to give a majority of their wealth during their lifetimes or in their wills. ——— The Associated Press receives support from the Lilly Endowment for coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-ease-lockdown-week-test-vaccine-passports-76882155,business,"LONDON -- Britain’s slow but steady march out of a three-month lockdown remains on track even as   cases surge elsewhere in Europe, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday, as he confirmed that businesses from barbers to bookstores will be allowed to reopen next week. Johnson said it’s too soon to decide, however, whether U.K. residents will be able to have summer trips abroad. He confirmed that the government will test out a contentious “vaccine passport” system — a way for people to offer proof they have protection from COVID-19 — as a tool to help travel and large events return safely. Four weeks after England took its first step out of lockdown by reopening schools, Johnson said Britain’s vaccination program was proceeding well and infections were falling. He said the next step would come as planned on April 12, with the reopening of hairdressers, beauty salons, gyms, nonessential shops and bar and restaurant patios. “We set out our road map and we’re sticking to it,” Johnson said during a news conference. But, he added, “We can’t be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries, and we’ve seen how this story goes.” A ban on overnight stays away from home in England will also be lifted April 12, and outdoor venues such as zoos and drive-in cinemas can operate again. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following similar but slightly different paths out of lockdown. Britain has recorded almost 127,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe. But infections and deaths both have fallen sharply during the current lockdown and since the start of a vaccination campaign that has given a first dose to more than 31 million people, or six in 10 adults. The government aims to give all adults at least one shot of vaccine by July, and hopes that a combination of vaccination and mass testing will allow indoor socializing and large-scale events to return. It says all adults and children in England will be encouraged to have routine coronavirus tests twice a week as a way to stamp out new outbreaks. The government said free lateral flow tests will be available free starting Friday by mail, from pharmacies and in workplaces. Lateral flow tests give results in minutes but are less accurate than the PCR swab tests used to officially confirm cases of COVID-19. But the government insists they are reliable and will help find people who contract the virus but don't have symptoms. Britons are currently banned by law from going on holiday abroad under the extraordinary powers Parliament has given the government to fight the pandemic. The government said Monday it won’t lift the travel ban before May 17 — and maybe later. “The government hopes people will be able to travel to and from the U.K. to take a summer holiday this year, but it is still too soon to know what is possible,” it said in an official update. Once travel resumes, Britain will rank countries on a traffic-light system as green, yellow or red based on their level of vaccinations, infections and worrying new virus variants. People arriving from “green” countries will have to be tested but won’t face quarantine. The government also is testing a system of “COVID-status certification” — often dubbed “vaccine passports” — that would allow people seeking to travel or attend events to show they either have received a coronavirus vaccine, tested negative for the virus, or recently had COVID-19 and therefore have some immunity. A series of events will start this month, including soccer matches, comedy shows and marathon races. The government said the first events will rely only on testing, “but in later pilots vaccination and acquired immunity are expected to be alternative ways to demonstrate status.” The issue of vaccine passports has been hotly debated around the world, raising questions about how much governments, employers and venues have a right to know about a person’s virus status. The idea is opposed by a wide swath of British lawmakers, from left-of-center opposition politicians to members of Johnson’s Conservative Party, and the policy could face stiff opposition when it is put before Parliament later this month. Conservative legislator Graham Brady said vaccine passports would be “intrusive, costly and unnecessary.” The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, called the idea “un-British.” The government said vaccine passports were all but unavoidable, since many countries were certain to demand proof of COVID-19 status for entry. And it said barring British businesses from asking customers for similar proof would be ""an unjustified intrusion on how businesses choose to make their premises safe.” The government said, however, that vaccine passports would never be needed to access “essential public services, public transport and essential shops.” Johnson acknowledged that vaccine passports raised “complicated ethical and practical issues"" and stressed their introduction wasn't imminent. ""We're some way off finalizing any plans for COVID-certification in the U.K.,"" he said. ——— Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/top-court-sides-google-copyright-dispute-oracle-76878874,business,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court sided Monday with Google in an $8 billion copyright dispute with Oracle over the internet company's creation of the Android operating system used on most smartphones worldwide. To create Android, which was released in 2007, Google wrote millions of lines of new computer code. But it also used 11,330 lines of code and an organization that’s part of Oracle’s Java platform. Google had argued that what it did is long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. And it said there is no copyright protection for the purely functional, noncreative computer code it used, something that couldn’t be written another way. But Austin, Texas-based Oracle said Google “committed an egregious act of plagiarism,” and it sued. The justices ruled 6-2 for Google Inc., based in Mountain View, California. Two conservative justices dissented. Justice Stephen Breyer         wrote  that in reviewing a lower court's decision, the justices assumed “for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable.” ""But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,” he wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito that he believed ""Oracle’s code at issue here is copyrightable, and Google’s use of that copyrighted code was anything but fair.” Only eight justices heard the case because it was         argued in October, after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but before Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court. In a statement, Google's chief legal officer, Kent Walker, called the ruling a “victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science."" “The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” Walker wrote. Oracle's chief legal officer, Dorian Daley, condemned the outcome. “The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater. The barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower. They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can,"" she wrote in a statement. Microsoft, IBM and major internet and tech industry lobbying groups had weighed in on the case in favor of Google. The Motion Picture Association and the Recording Industry Association of America were among those supporting Oracle. The case is Google LLC v. Oracle America Inc., 18-956."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/yellen-calls-minimum-global-corporate-income-tax-76881555,business,"WASHINGTON -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday urged the adoption of a minimum global corporate income tax, an effort to offset any disadvantages that might arise from the Biden administration's proposed increase in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Citing a “thirty-year race to the bottom” in which countries have slashed corporate tax rates in an effort to attract multinational businesses, Yellen said the Biden administration would work with other advanced economies in the Group of 20 to set a minimum. “Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” Yellen said in a virtual speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods.” The speech was Yellen's highest-profile so far on international affairs, and came just as the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund began in a virtual format. “It is important to work with other countries to end the pressures of tax competition and corporate tax base erosion,” Yellen said. President   has proposed hiking the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, partially undoing the Trump administration's cut from 35% in its 2017 tax legislation. Biden also wants to set a minimum U.S. tax on overseas corporate income, and to make it harder for companies to shift earnings offshore. The increase would help pay for the White House's ambitious         $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal. Also on Monday, Biden said he was “not at all” concerned that a higher corporate tax rate would cause some U.S. companies to relocate overseas, though Yellen's proposed global minimum corporate tax is intended to prevent that from happening. “There's no evidence to that ... that's bizarre,” Biden said in response to a question from reporters. According to the Tax Foundation, the Trump administration’s corporate tax reduction lowered the U.S. rate from the highest among the 37 advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to the 13th highest. Many analysts have argued, however, that few large U.S. multinationals paid the full tax. “We have 51 or 52 corporations from the Fortune 500 who haven’t paid a single penny a day for 3 years?” Biden said. “Come on.” Yellen, meanwhile, downplayed the potential for the Biden administration’s domestic agenda, which also includes a $1.9 trillion COVID relief package approved last month, to spur higher inflation. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, among others, has raised such concerns since the relief bill passed. “I strongly doubt that it's going to cause inflationary pressures,” Yellen said, referring to the administration's infrastructure proposal. “The problem for a very long time has been inflation that’s too low, not inflation that’s too high.” Yellen also said the United States will step up its efforts at home and overseas to fight climate change, “after sitting on the sidelines for four years.” Treasury will work to “promote the flow of capital toward climate-aligned investments and away from carbon-intensive investments,"" Yellen said. That approach has raised the ire of GOP members of Congress, who say it threatens the ability of the U.S. oil and gas industry to access needed lending. Yellen also noted that many developing nations are lagging in vaccinating their populations, and have also experienced harsh economic consequences from the pandemic. As many as 150 million people worldwide will fall into extreme poverty this year, Yellen said. “The result will likely be a deeper and longer-lasting crisis, with mounting problems of indebtedness, more entrenched poverty, and growing inequality,” Yellen said. The Biden administration supports the creation of $650 billion in new lending capacity at the IMF to address such issues, she said. Many Republicans in Congress oppose the new allotment, arguing that much of the funding would flow to relatively better-off developing countries, such as China. Yellen acknowledged that the additional credit would be distributed to each IMF member, but argued that “significant resources will go to the poorest countries most in need.” Nations can also donate some of their funds to the hardest-hit countries, which she expects many will do, she added."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/twitter-slowdown-russia-mid-block-now-76878287,business,"MOSCOW -- Russian authorities said Monday they would continue to slow down   until mid-May, but wouldn't block the social media platform for now because it has started to remove banned content faster. The announcement marks somewhat of a reprieve in the recent standoff between the Russian government and the platform, which has played a role in amplifying dissent in Russia. Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor accused   last month of failing to remove content encouraging suicide among children, as well as information about drugs and child pornography. The agency announced on March 10 it was slowing down the speed of uploading photos and videos to the platform, and less then a week later threatened to block it within a month if it continues to not comply with the demands. In response to the accusations, Twitter has emphasized its policy of zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation, the promotion of suicide and drug sales. Roskomnadzor said in a statement Monday that it decided not to block the social media platform, “taking into account the decision made by Twitter for the first time to change the principles and speed of its own moderation service in Russia, and the removal of a significant part of the prohibited content."" The agency said that Twitter has taken down around 1,900 of 3,100 posts containing child pornography, and information about drugs and suicide. The platform has increased the speed of deleting banned content, according to Roskomnadzor — it currently takes 81 hours to do it. Still, Russian laws require social media to take down prohibited content within 24 hours of being notified about it. In light of these developments, Roskomnadzor will continue to slow down Twitter until May 15, giving it “additional time to remove all prohibited content ... and bring its operations into full compliance” with Russian law. Russian authorities criticized social media platforms earlier this year for bringing tens of thousands of people into the streets across the country in January to demand the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most well-known critic. The wave of demonstrations was the largest in years and posed a major challenge to the Kremlin. The authorities alleged that social media platforms failed to remove calls for children to join the protests. Putin has urged police to act more to monitor social media platforms and to track down those who draw children into ""illegal and unsanctioned street actions.” The Russian government’s efforts to tighten control of the internet and social media date back to 2012, when a law allowing authorities to blacklist and block certain online content was adopted. Since then, a growing number of restrictions targeting messaging apps, websites and social media platforms have been introduced in Russia. The government has repeatedly aired threats to block Facebook and Twitter, but stopped short of outright bans — probably fearing the move would elicit too much public outrage. Only the social network LinkedIn, which wasn’t very popular in Russia, has been banned by authorities for the failure to store its user data in Russia."

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/push-diversify-banking-industry/story?id=76568426,business,"The racial reckoning in America calling for diversity has touched every industry including banking. According to a report from the   -- a bank workers' advocacy group -- Black and Latino employees have a significantly smaller chance of holding an executive position in corporate banks in comparison to their white counterparts. ""I heard lots of stories of workers of color who said, 'I've applied for 15 jobs, 20 jobs, never got an interview, I always had good, performance reviews by my manager ...  but never got an interview,'"" Nick Weiner the lead author of the CBB report told ABC News. The report finds that Black and Latino employees at 13 major U.S. banks have a less than 25% chance of being promoted or hired for a senior management or executive position in comparison to their white colleagues. Black and Latinos also have a very high likelihood of being in an entry-level position with limited mobility, such as bank teller and call center employees in comparison to their white colleges, the report also found. The study gave the financial industry a ""C"" grade for diversity. African American and Latino representation were given a ""D"" and Asian representation, a ""C."" A lack of diversity in corporate America is nothing new, but the impact is even more widespread in banking. African Americans and Hispanics are less likely than their white counterparts to receive home mortgages, personal loans and are more likely to lack trust in banking and lack banking access and resources. Reese Giddins, the president of  , Bank who worked in corporate banking for several years before helping to start minority-focused and owned bank Greenwood, said the lack of diversity may contribute to the lack of trust in financial institutions from minorities. ""When you don't have people that look like you, that can't understand you, and can't help you, it's hard to build that trust. With Greenwood, we're trying to rebuild that trust in our community along with the recirculation of the dollars into the community as well as bringing in that talent,"" Giddins told ABC News. Many banks including those studied in the CBB report released statements following the death of George Floyd, promising to diversify and provide racial equity. However, further steps to diversify the industry are needed, said Wells Fargo employee Ted Laurel. ""I would say that we would need more change beyond just adding more ranks of minorities into our leadership ... A two-prong approach would definitely help moving the employees up from the bottom that we already have, and then also recruiting more diverse talent, especially from those minority colleges,""  Laurel said. A number of banks including US Bank and Wells Fargo were given an ""F"" grade in the report. According to the report authors, these banks declined to provide its researchers with data on ""the total number of employees within race groups at the company."" A spokesperson from Wells Fargo told ABC News, the company has work to do with improving diversity, but is making strides. ""Wells Fargo is committed to doing the work to ensure we provide our employees with an inclusive and respectful workplace where diverse talent flourishes. While we have more work to do, we have taken steps that include creating a diverse segments, representation and inclusion group reporting directly to the CEO that is accountable for progress and execution of new and existing programs, conducting diversity-focused talent reviews and sponsorship programs to help promote underrepresented groups, assessing senior leaders on increasing diverse representation at leadership levels, and requiring unconscious bias training for all managers. We are committed to sharing results,"" Well Fargo told ABC News via a statement. ""In 2020, we broadly disclosed our EEO-1 data for the first time, and we intend to publish our 2019 and 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 gender/race employment data in the summer of 2021 as part of our updated ESG reporting process. Wells Fargo values diversity and inclusion not just as a business imperative, but because it's the right thing to do,"" Wells Fargo senior vice president Kate Pulley also said in a statement to ABC News.  has also recently hired Kleber Santos in November of 2020, to lead Diverse Segments, Representation & Inclusion to improve internal diversity and equity. US Bank employee Marcus Dodson said transparency is needed to fully see how the issue is being resolved. ""What I would like to see is transparency ... a focus on diversity. From what I've seen, we've had these trainings that we take online. I would say that there hasn't been a focus on minority hiring, minority issues or having difficult conversations,"" Dodson said US Bank declined ABC News' request for an interview but released the following statement: ""The findings in this report are not accurate and do not reflect information we've released publicly, including in our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, which is available on our  ,"" US Bank vice president Lee Henderson said in a statement. According to its Social and Governance report, US Bank has committed to $100 million annually in access to capital for Black business owners, and provided $1 million to Black-led community development financial institutions. Greenwood, which Giddins says officially will launch this summer, has recently announced Wells Fargo as one of their top investors. However, Reese is hoping the partnership from their investors which he said also includes Mastercard, Bank of America, and Chase, leads to more than just financial gains. ""What we're focused on and really trying to create is trust back in the community, the opportunity to, affect Black and Latin[o] businesses. That's really our focus. And that's really what we're trying to get to out of these partnerships that we have…I'd like to see more sponsorship of classrooms and inner cities,  to essentially, help individuals who want careers in banking. I'd like to see more processes in place, for folks that work the phone but that have the skill set to move up,"" Giddins says."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/supreme-court-dismisses-case-trump-twitter-critics-76878606,business,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a case over former President  's efforts to block critics from his personal   account. The court said there was nothing left to the case after Trump was permanently suspended from   and ended his presidential term in January. Twitter banned Trump two days after the deadly attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters on Jan. 6. The company said its decision was “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.” The court also formally threw out an appeals court ruling that found Trump violated the First Amendment whenever he blocked a critic to silence a viewpoint. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion arguing that the bigger issue raised by the case, and especially Twitter's decision to boot Trump, is “the dominant digital platforms themselves. As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms.” Thomas agreed with his colleagues about the outcome of the case, but said the situation raises “interesting and important questions.” The case concerned the @realdonaldtrump account with more than 88 million followers and Trump's argument that it is his personal property. The Justice Department argued that blocking people from it was akin to elected officials who refuse to allow their opponents’ yard signs on their front lawns. But the federal appeals court in New York ruled last year that Trump used the account to make daily pronouncements and observations that are overwhelmingly official in nature. The case had been styled Trump v. Knight First Amendment Institute, the group that originally sued to challenge Trump's decision to block his critics. But when Trump left office, President   replaced Trump in the case's title, though the new president had nothing to do with the lawsuit."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gamestop-finally-announces-share-sale-76876203,business,"Two months after a market phenomenon took shares of GameStop to the moon, the video game retailer said Monday that it will sell up to 3.5 million of its shares. The shares will be sold through an “at-the-market” offering, which lets companies place their stock on the market over a period of time. The announcement sent shares of GameStop, up 850% this year, down 8% at the opening bell. The GameStop saga has been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street this year. The company had been pummeled as new technology allowed people to download games, rather than buying a physical copy from GameStop or somewhere else. That shift threatened the existence of GameStop and its shares had been more than halved, to $20 each, by the start of this year. A number of hedge funds, believing the value of GameStop shares would fall further, shorted the company, or bet against its shares. However, a group of smaller investors who communicated largely on   challenged those hedge funds, believing they were wrong or that they could catch them in a “short squeeze."" To short a stock, an investor borrows shares at the current price for a fee, and buys them back at a later date. If the shares fall, the investors pockets the difference. If it rises, it can lead to massive losses because the borrowed stock is now worth more than was paid for it, and the investor must pay the difference. That's exactly what happened this year and shares of GameStop rocketed from $20, to $483, and ravaging short sellers like Citron Research. At the same time, it made a bunch of small investors very wealthy. Market pundits had urged the company to put more shares on the market as the price spiked. Such a stock sale would have allowed to company to pay down hefty debts and even revive the company by pursuing a new business plan. And two weeks ago,         GameStop  disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it actually had been considering such a move since January. Even though it did not announce the share sale when share prices peaked, GameStop could wipe existing debt of the books if it chooses. The company's stock closed at $191.45 last week, meaning it could raise as much as $670 million. GameStop's net debt was around $430 million in January. However, because the sale is ""at-the-market,” it gives the company more flexibility as to when the sales happen. A company's shares typically slide after it announces it will sell more shares because it tends to water down the value of shares that are already out there. That's certainly what happened Monday. Yet the GameStop story has veered from what most would consider reality for four months now and it remains to be seen if those smaller investors will continue to play this game. And more importantly, the volatile trading has attracted bigger players, making the trade even riskier. Still, shares had fallen as much as 16% before the opening bell and bounced back somewhat in early trading Monday. This year, double-digit swings in the company's stock has become common. The company, based in Grapevine, Texas, also said Monday that preliminary fiscal first-quarter to-date global sales are up about 11% from a year ago, a period when the pandemic slammed the U.S. and retailers like GameStop were forced to close its stores."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/corporations-gave-50m-voting-restriction-backers-76873491,business,"WASHINGTON -- When         executives from Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines spoke out against Georgia's new voting law as unduly restrictive last week, it seemed to signal a new activism springing from corporate America. But if leaders of the nation's most prominent companies are going to reject lawmakers who support restrictive voting measures, they will have to abruptly reverse course. State legislators across the country who have pushed for new voting restrictions, and also seized on former President  's baseless claims of   fraud, have reaped more than $50 million in corporate donations in recent years,         according to a new report by Public Citizen, a Washington-based government watchdog group. Telecom giant AT&T was the most prolific, donating over $800,000 since 2015 to authors of proposed restrictions, cosponsors of such measures, or those who voted in favor of the bills, the report found. Other top donors during the same period include Comcast, Philip Morris USA, UnitedHealth Group, Walmart, Verizon, General Motors and Pfizer. The money may not have been given with voting laws in mind, but it nonetheless helped cement Republican control in statehouses where many of the prohibitive measures are now moving forward. Whether companies continue to give to these lawmakers will test how far risk-averse corporate leaders are willing to go in their increasingly forceful criticism of the restrictive efforts, which voting rights groups have excoriated as an attack on democracy. ""It really is corporate America, as a whole, that is funding these politicians,” said Mike Tanglis, one of the authors of the report. “It seems many are trying to hide under a rock and hope that this issue passes.” More than 120 companies detailed in the report previously said they would rethink their donations to members of Congress who, acting on the same falsehoods as the state lawmakers, objected to the certification of President Joe Biden's win following         the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. The tension is most evident now in Georgia, where a far-reaching new voting law has drawn an intense national scrutiny, prompting the criticism from Delta and Coca-Cola. On Friday, MLB announced it would no longer host         the 2021 All-Star Game in Atlanta. Yet it's unclear whether this aggressive new posture will extend to corporate campaign donation practices. And early indicators show there is risk. Georgia's         Republican-controlled House voted to strip Delta of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars annually for their criticism of the new law, though the action was rendered moot after the GOP Senate failed to take it up before the legislative session adjourned. What is certain, though, is that withholding corporate donations to state-level candidates, like many companies did at the federal level, would have a far greater impact in statehouses. “A contribution of $5,000 to a U.S. senator who is raising $30 million is a drop in a bucket. But in some of these state races, a few thousand dollars can buy a lot of ad time,” said Tanglis. “If corporate America is going to say that (Trump's) lie is unacceptable on the federal level, what about on the state level?” Public Citizen analyzed about 245 voting restriction bills proposed before March 1. They culled a list of sponsors and cosponsors, while also analyzing vote roll calls. Then they cross-referenced the data with state-level donation records dating back to 2015, which included money from company political action committees, as well as direct contributions from corporate treasuries. Among their findings: — Companies donated at least $50 million to lawmakers who supported voting restrictions, including $22 million in the 2020 campaign cycle. — At least 81 Fortune 100 companies have given a combined total of $7.7 million to supporters of the restrictions. — Nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies donated a combined total of $12.8 million to supporters of the restrictions. — About three-quarters of the companies that changed their donation policies after the U.S. Capitol attack have also given to lawmakers who supported voting rights restrictions. — More than 60 companies have given at least $100,000 to lawmakers who supported the restrictions. — Separately, industry groups and trade associations contributed an additional $36 million to the lawmakers, $16 million of which was given during the 2020 cycle. In response, AT&T said “the right to vote is sacred” but declined to say whether the company would withhold donations to state lawmakers as they did for members of Congress who objected to Biden's win. “We understand that   laws are complicated, not our company’s expertise and ultimately the responsibility of elected officials. But, as a company, we have a responsibility to engage,"" AT&T CEO John Stankey said in a statement. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said in a statement, “We strongly oppose the passage of any legislation or the adoption of any measure that would make it harder"" to vote. But he stopped short of pledging any specific action. Comcast said in a statement that ""efforts to limit or impede access to this vital constitutional right for any citizen are not consistent with our values.” The company would not comment on whether it would evaluate its giving to lawmakers who support the measures. Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, said in a statement that “every eligible voter should be able to exercise their right to vote” and pledged to monitor lawmakers' “alignment with our political contribution guiding principles when making future contribution decisions."" Other companies listed in the report declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries from The Associated Press. On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged companies to resist what he called a “coordinated campaign by powerful and wealthy people to mislead and bully the American people.” “Our private sector must stop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex,"" the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. “Americans do not need or want big business to amplify ... or react to every manufactured controversy with frantic left-wing signaling.” Pressure has been particularly intense in Georgia, where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp recently signed a sweeping new law that bans people from handing out food or water to voters waiting in line and allows the Republican-controlled State Election Board to remove and replace county election officials, among many other provisions. Two of the top corporate contribution recipients detailed in Public Citizen's report were among the sponsors of the measure. Since 2015, Republican state Sen. Jeff Mullis has collected more than $869,000 in donation from corporate PACs. Among his top corporate donors were AT&T ($15,900) and UnitedHealth Group ($12,900), according to the report. Mullis is chair of the Georgia Senate’s Rules Committee, which plays a key role in determining which bills make it to the floor for a vote. Republican state Sen. Butch Miller, another sponsor of the bill, has received at least $729,000 in corporate donations since 2015. Among his top corporate givers are UnitedHealth Group ($15,700) and AT&T ($13,600), the report states. Miller and Mullis did not respond to requests for comment."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/georgia-governor-vows-fight-mlb-yanks-star-game-76856937,business,"News of Major League Baseball’s decision to pull this summer’s All-Star Game from Georgia over its sweeping new voting law reverberated among fans Saturday, while Gov. Brian Kemp vowed to defend the measure, saying “free and fair  s” are worth any threats, boycotts or lawsuits. The Republican governor said at a news conference that MLB “caved to fear and lies from liberal activists” when it         yanked the July 13 game from Atlanta’s Truist Park. He added the decision will hurt working people in the state and have long-term consequences on the economy. “I want to be clear: I will not be backing down from this fight. We will not be intimidated, and we will also not be silenced,” Kemp said. ""Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams, Joe Biden and the left, but I am not,” he said, referring to companies that have also         criticized the new law. Three groups already have filed a lawsuit over         the measure, which includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run. Critics say it violates the First and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as parts of the federal Voting Rights Act that say states cannot restrict Black voter participation. The governor insists opponents have mischaracterized what the law does, yet Republican lawmakers made the changes largely in response to false claims of fraud in the 2020 elections made by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. The law includes a new photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail and makes it a misdemeanor to hand out money or gifts, including food or drink, to those waiting in line, which Kemp said was done to prevent groups from trying to influence voters. The prohibition extends 150 feet from a polling place and 25 feet from any person standing in line. It also expands weekend early voting, although Republicans had earlier proposed limiting it. Abrams, who has         championed voting rights since narrowly losing to Kemp in the 2018 election, is among those who have spoken out against it. The Democrat is being closely watched to see if she seeks a 2022 rematch. Fans, meanwhile, appeared divided on pulling the game from Georgia. Patrick Smith, a lifelong Braves fan in Ellisville, Mississippi, said he thinks the league made the right decision and noted that not taking a stand would have polarized some supporters. “When governments restrict access to the ballot box, someone has to step in to encourage these entities to roll back those measures,"" he said. Lorre Sweetman, in Kahului, Hawaii, said it was a poor move by MLB because it wasn’t based on the actual new voting laws but on “political pandering” and misinformation. Still, while some fans upset about the decision have called for a boycott of professional baseball, she said she will not stop watching games and her three grandsons are still learning the sport. “They caved to pressure without considering the message this sends to fans who just want to enjoy the game and support their team,” she said. “We need to take politics out of sports.” But Dick Pagano, a baseball fan in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, said he will not watch or attend any games this year. “They shot themselves in the foot,"" said Pagano, who added he will be disappointed to miss the planned Hank Aaron celebration during the All-Star Game, since he once saw him play in the 1957 World Series. Aaron, who played for the Braves in Atlanta and Milwaukee for most of his career, faced extensive hate mail and racism as he closed in on breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record. Jeffrey Guterman, a retired mental health counselor in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who calls himself an amateur baseball historian, said the decision shows baseball changing with the times. “I’m surprised when people argue that moving it away from Atlanta is a bad move because it would bring lots of money to the area,” he said. “The question is what costs more, moving the All-Star Game or reinforcing the oppression of votes.” The league did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred previously said he made the call to move the All-Star events and the amateur draft from Atlanta after discussions with individual players and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year. A new ballpark for the events wasn’t immediately revealed. Kemp also criticized the league for not trying to improve voter access in its home state of New York, where he said voters need an excuse to vote by mail and have fewer days of early voting than in Georgia. He said its decision means “cancel culture” is coming for American businesses and jobs. Trump also blasted the league's move, while former President Barack Obama congratulated MLB for its decision, saying there was no better way for baseball to honor Aaron, “who always led by example."" Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina said he’s asked his staff to begin drafting a bill to remove the league’s antitrust law exemption in response to the decision. “An overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans support requiring an ID to vote, and any organization that abuses its power to oppose secure elections deserves increased scrutiny under the law,” he said in a tweet. Baseball antitrust exemptions, in place since a 1922 Supreme Court decision, primarily allow MLB to prevent franchise moves without owner approval. ——— Anderson reported from New York, and Willingham from Jackson, Mississippi.

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jalen-suggs-banks-buzzer-beating-beat-ucla-gonzaga/story?id=76861983,sports,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Three dribbles, 55 feet and one of the greatest shots in NCAA tournament and Final Four history. UCLA's           scored with 3.3 seconds left to tie the game, and Gonzaga coach Mark Few elected not to call a timeout. Bulldogs forward            grabbed the ball out of the net, while           began to curl toward the ball to catch it on the run. Kispert threw the ball inbounds to Suggs, who took three dribbles and pulled up from about 40 feet to bank in a winning 3 to give Gonzaga a 93-90 overtime win over UCLA on Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium, advancing the Bulldogs to Monday's national championship game          . Suggs fist-pumped into the air and sprinted to the scorer's table as his teammates mobbed him. ""I've always wanted to run up on the table like Kobe and D-Wade and go like that, and that's the first thing I did,"" said Suggs, Gonzaga's star guard. ""Man, that is something that you practice on your mini-hoop as a kid or in the gym just messing around. And to be able to do that, it's crazy."" The Zags' quest for an unbeaten national championship season survived, just barely. ""It helps when you have a magical, special guy like Jalen,"" Few said. UCLA's Cinderella run through the NCAA tournament nearly took down another victim, as the 11-seed Bruins gave Gonzaga all it could handle and then some. There were 19 lead changes, and the biggest lead for either team was Gonzaga's seven-point edge in the second half. The Bulldogs had barely been tested all season, with 29 of their 30 wins entering Saturday coming by double-digits. It was clear from the outset that wouldn't be the case in the national semifinals. UCLA matched Gonzaga basket for basket in the first half, even taking a six-point lead with 4:55 remaining until halftime. Bruins coach Mick Cronin once again had a masterclass in game planning, limiting Gonzaga's transition opportunities and refusing to push the ball on fast breaks, even when the Bruins might have had an advantage. They ran the shot clock down on nearly every possession and made tough shots all night. Before his buzzer shot, Suggs had already made a case for the play of the tournament. With two minutes left in regulation, he came from behind and blocked what looked like an easy basket for          . He kept the ball inbounds, then pushed it upcourt before threading the needle with a one-handed bounce pass to           for a dunk. Instead of a two-point deficit, Gonzaga had a two-point lead. ""I couldn't give him a free bucket,"" Suggs said of Riley. ""Either I was going to find him at the line or make a play on the ball. I went to the corner, it was tough to get it. I got it. I saw Drew running, and           is fast. I wanted to throw it. It looked wide open. And then as soon as I let it go out of my hands, he had like another gear. It made it a lot closer than I wanted it to be. I knew Coach was maybe a little pissed that I made the pass, but it got through."" ""He's a hell of a player. I mean, he's electric,"" Few said of Suggs. ""Especially when you get him out in transition. He's confident enough. And to make that pass to Timme. When I saw him sizing it up, I was not thinking it was going to be one of his greatest decisions he's ever had. But he's got a knack for just fitting things into small windows."" Juzang was again outstanding for UCLA, continuing the stellar stretch he has had all NCAA tournament. He was unguardable at times, finishing with 29 points, the fourth time in the tournament he has scored at least 23 points. And it looked like he might deliver another shocking upset win over a 1-seed late in regulation, when he drove the lane and drew a whistle with 1.1 seconds left. But instead of a fifth foul on Timme, it was a charge on Juzang and five more minutes to play. ""[Timme is] our best charge-taker by far. I mean, I don't know how I felt about that, with four fouls,"" Few said. ""But he took it, God bless him, and it was a big play."" Timme was exceptional in the extra period, scoring Gonzaga's first six points to give the Bulldogs some breathing room. But as it did all game, UCLA kept fighting and had possession following a missed 3 by Corey Kispert with 22 seconds left. Juzang drove the lane and missed a runner, but he got his own miss and put it back to tie the score with 3.3 seconds left. Gonzaga had one timeout remaining, but Few wasn't going to use it. Suggs made one of the greatest shots in NCAA tournament history and sent the Zags to Monday night's title game. ""I knew we were good because it was in Jalen's hands,"" Few said. ""He makes shots. He's got that magical aura. He makes them in practice all the time. It's been crazy this year how many he's made in practice, last-second shots. I felt pretty good. I was staring right at it. And I said, 'It's in.' And it was."" Suggs, a former high school football star, said his greatest all-time sports moment entering college was a high school football championship his senior year. He has a new one now. ""It skyrockets above that,"" said Suggs, who could barely contain his joy in the postgame news conference. ""I mean, it was nuts. And I still can't speak. I have so many things going on in my head. I just can't believe that happened. I don't think it's really going to hit me until I wake up tomorrow. Tonight was special."" ""When dreams start to become realities and you're able to experience those things, it's special,"" he later added. ""And those are things you've got to cherish. You're never going to get another moment like this. You'll never be able to relive this."" So now on Monday we get the game college basketball has wanted since the season began, the game we were denied in early December because of COVID-19: Gonzaga vs. Baylor. It will be the first time since 2005 the top two teams on the NCAA tournament's 1-68 seed list will face each other in the national championship game. ""I think now they're back playing the way they were earlier this year,"" Few said. ""And so well-coached. Stepping up, making shots. Playing great defense. ... We've got to get ready for a terrific Baylor team. And we're going to have to play great."" Forty minutes to perfection and a place in history."

The           rookie got three hits in his first three at-bats Saturday against the           to improve to 8-for-8 to start 2021, the most consecutive hits to start a season by any player in the modern era (since 1900). Mercedes, who had one major league at-bat entering the season, going 0-for-1 in 2020, has started at DH the past two games and tortured the Angels with his two-strike hitting -- five of the eight hits have come with two strikes. After homering in the second inning on Saturday for his first career home run, Mercedes' eighth straight hit came in the sixth inning, a double that bounced off the warning track in left-center. ""I'm just trying to wait for my pitch and not do too much,"" Mercedes said after the           in Anaheim. ""Just stay right there and swing hard. It doesn't matter if it is two strikes or no strikes, I just want to see the ball.'' In his ninth at-bat, Mercedes flew out to center field to end his streak. He finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs and a run scored on Saturday. ""All of his hits have been clutch and he has been putting us in position to try to win,"" manager Tony LaRussa said. ""He has had a great approach, especially with two strikes."" Mercedes is a 28-year-old rookie who has bounced around three organizations, originally signed by the Nationals and spending time with the Orioles before the White Sox signed him in 2018. He wasn't expected to be a big part of the lineup, but           's injury has opened up playing time, with projected DH           starting the past two games in left field. LaRussa said Mercedes was supposed to have the night off Saturday but that he earned his way into the lineup with his 5-for-5 night. Mercedes has spent most of his time in the minor leagues at catcher but does own a .302 career minor league average, and in 2019, he hit .317/.388/.581 with 23 home runs in 95 games between Double-A and Triple-A. ""I never imagined that. It is great for me,"" Mercedes said of his start. ""Now, it's a new day for me. I want to keep doing well and work with my approach. I want to play every day and I'm excited for that."" Before Mercedes, the only player since 1900 to get five hits in his first career start was Cecil Travis, who went 5-for-7 for the Washington Senators in 1933. The overall record for consecutive hits at any point in a season is 12, shared by the Cubs' Johnny Kling (1902) and two Red Sox players, Pinky Higgins (1938) and Walt Dropo (1952)."

Seven players and a coach were already on the list, prompting the NHL to postpone Canucks games until April 8, with the practice facility opening no sooner than April 6. According to sources, the Canucks' recent additions to the protocol list could keep them out of action even longer.

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jalen-suggs-banks-buzzer-beating-beat-ucla-final/story?id=76863157,sports,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Three dribbles, 55 feet and one of the greatest shots in NCAA tournament and Final Four history. UCLA's           scored with 3.3 seconds left to tie the score, and Gonzaga coach Mark Few elected not to call a timeout. Bulldogs forward            grabbed the ball out of the net, while           began to curl toward the ball to catch it on the run. Kispert threw the ball in bounds to Suggs, who took three dribbles and pulled up from about 40 feet to bank in a buzzer-beating 3 to give Gonzaga a           over the 11-seed Bruins on Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium, advancing the Bulldogs to Monday's national championship game          . Suggs fist-pumped into the air and sprinted to the scorer's table as his teammates mobbed him. ""I've always wanted to run up on the table like Kobe and D-Wade and go like that, and that's the first thing I did,"" said Suggs, Gonzaga's star guard. ""Man, that is something that you practice on your mini-hoop as a kid or in the gym just messing around. And to be able to do that, it's crazy."" The Zags' quest for an unbeaten national championship season survived, just barely. ""It helps when you have a magical, special guy like Jalen,"" Few said. UCLA's Cinderella run through the NCAA tournament nearly took down another victim, as the Bruins gave Gonzaga (31-0) all it could handle and then some. There were 19 lead changes, and the biggest lead for either team was Gonzaga's seven-point edge in the second half. The Bulldogs had barely been tested all season, with 29 of their 30 wins entering Saturday coming by double digits. It was clear from the outset that wouldn't be the case in the national semifinals. UCLA matched Gonzaga basket for basket in the first half, even taking a six-point lead with 4 minutes, 55 seconds remaining until halftime. Bruins coach Mick Cronin once again had a masterclass in game planning, limiting Gonzaga's transition opportunities and refusing to push the ball on fast breaks, even when the Bruins might have had an advantage. They ran the shot clock down on nearly every possession and made tough shots all night. Before his buzzer shot, Suggs had already made a case for the play of the tournament. With two minutes left in regulation, he came from behind and blocked what looked like an easy basket for          . He kept the ball inbounds, then pushed it upcourt before threading the needle with a one-handed bounce pass to           for a dunk. Instead of a two-point deficit, Gonzaga had a two-point lead. ""I couldn't give him a free bucket,"" Suggs said of Riley. ""Either I was going to find him at the line or make a play on the ball. I went to the corner -- it was tough to get it. I got it. I saw Drew running, and           is fast. I wanted to throw it. It looked wide open. And then as soon as I let it go out of my hands, he had like another gear. It made it a lot closer than I wanted it to be. I knew Coach was maybe a little pissed that I made the pass, but it got through."" ""He's a hell of a player. I mean, he's electric,"" Few said of Suggs. ""Especially when you get him out in transition. He's confident enough. And to make that pass to Timme. When I saw him sizing it up, I was not thinking it was going to be one of his greatest decisions he's ever had. But he's got a knack for just fitting things into small windows.""

The Miami company said its precautions go well beyond steps taken by others in the travel and leisure industry that have already reopened, including airlines, hotel, restaurants and sporting events. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd plans to begin U.S. sailings at 60% of capacity and raise that to 80% in August and 100% in September. Norwegian also operates Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Company shares jumped 6% Monday and pulled the shares of rival cruise lines hire as well. Shares Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Group gained nearly 5% and more than 3%, respectively. CEO Frank Del Rio detailed the request in a letter to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has blocked cruise ships from U.S. ports with a no-sail order since March 2020, after outbreaks on several ships around the world. On Friday, the CDC updated its guidance to say that fully vaccinated people can travel within the U.S. without getting tested for the   or going into quarantine afterward. It also issued more technical details around its conditional plan to allow cruise ships in U.S. ports, but it did not say when cruise lines could resume sailing. Still, Walensky urged caution and said she would “advocate against general travel overall” given the rising number of infections. The CDC said Monday that it “is committed to working with the cruise industry and seaport partners to resume cruising” following a phased approach. “Cruising safely and responsibly during a global pandemic is difficult,” especially with concern over new variants of COVID-19, the agency added."

""Jrue is one of the top guards in the NBA and we are thrilled to sign him to this extension,"" Bucks general manager Jon Horst said in a statement announcing the agreement.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/putin-signs-law-serve-terms-76880556,business,"MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036, a move that formalizes constitutional changes endorsed in a vote last year. The July 1 constitutional vote included a provision that reset Putin's previous term limits, allowing him to run for president two more times. The change was rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled legislature and the relevant law signed by Putin was posted Monday on an official portal of legal information. The 68-year-old Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends. He has argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of “darting their eyes in search for possible successors.” The constitutional amendments also emphasized the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlawed same-sex marriages and mentioned “a belief in God” as a core value. Nearly 78% of voters approved the constitutional amendments during the balloting that lasted for a week and concluded on July 1. Turnout was 68%. Following the vote, Russian lawmakers have methodically modified the national legislation, approving the relevant laws. The opposition criticized the constitutional vote, arguing that it was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities, as well as a lack of transparency and hurdles hindering independent monitoring. In the months since the vote, Russia has imprisoned the country's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, The 44-year-old Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation. In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful. His team says Navalny has lost a substantial amount of weight while on a hunger strike to protest what he said was poor medical care."

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wisconsin-earns-top-seed-48-team-ncaa-womens/story?id=76870312,sports,"Wisconsin was awarded the No. 1 seed in the NCAA women's volleyball tournament, which begins April 14. The bracket was released Sunday for the 48-team tournament, which will be played entirely in a bubble-like setting in Omaha, Nebraska. Normally, women's volleyball is a fall sport with a 64-team NCAA tournament in December. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was split this school year as some teams -- including from the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences -- played only after January, while others also had fall matches. Thus, the teams involved have a big disparity in the number of matches they have played heading into the tournament. The tournament was downsized to 48 teams, so the top 16 seeds all have first-round byes. Teams from the same conference are not paired during the first two rounds. Wisconsin was the national runner-up in 2019, 2013 and 2000, and the 13-0 Badgers are seeking their first NCAA volleyball championship. Volleyball doesn't seed its entire field, just the top 16. Rounding out the top four seeds are No. 2 Kentucky, No. 3 Minnesota and No. 4 Texas. The rest of the seeds are: No. 5 Nebraska, No. 6 Washington, No. 7 Purdue, No. 8 Florida, No. 9 Ohio State, No. 10 Oregon, No. 11 Louisville, No. 12 Baylor, No. 13 Penn State, No. 14 Utah, No. 15 Washington State and No. 16 BYU. Defending champion Stanford, which won three of the past four championships and has an NCAA-best nine titles overall, missed the field for the first time since the NCAA tournament began in 1981. The Cardinal had multiple matches canceled due to COVID-19 issues, and played just 10 all season, going 2-8. Penn State is now the only program that has made every NCAA tournament field. The Big Ten has six teams in the field to lead all conferences, while the Pac-12 has five and the ACC four. N.C. A&T and Utah Valley are making their NCAA tournament debuts. All matches will be at the CHI Health Center Omaha facility, which has both an arena and convention center. Early-round matches will be played April 14-15, with regional semifinals set for April 18. All those matches will be at the convention center. Regional finals will be April 19. The final four will take place April 22 and 24 on ESPN2. All those matches will be at the arena. Matches throughout the tournament will be streamed on ESPN3."

Globe Life Field in Arlington will be the first Major League Baseball stadium to reopen at full capacity -- roughly 40,000 seats -- since the pandemic began. The move comes a month after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ended the state's mask mandate and asked businesses to reopen fully, citing declining COVID-19 cases and vaccination numbers. In a statement released on March 10, Neil Leibman, the team’s president of business operations, said the Rangers were encouraged by the governor's orders and were taking measures to ensure fans were safe, including requiring masks, except for while eating. Following Monday's home opener, the stadium will have sections that allow fans to watch with ""distanced seating."" “We will continue to monitor developments and implement the necessary public health measures,” Leibman said in a statement. The Houston Astros, Texas' other MLB team, will only be operating at 50% of Minute Maid Park's roughly 41,000 seat capacity for April. The stadium will also require masks for fans when they're not eating. Dr. Emily Landon, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago,   that baseball and other outdoor sports provide better protection for crowds than indoor arenas, since it's harder for air particles to linger. While she said the decision by MLB teams to reopen their games to fans was safe, she warned that the Rangers' full capacity reopening was riskier, due to the sheer number of people crowded together. The country is still seeing thousands of cases a day, particularly from the virus variants, Landon noted. ""You don’t know who is going to come in with COVID-19,"" she told ABC News. Biden weighed in on the Rangers' plans during an   last week, calling the move ""not responsible."" ""They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, the scientists and the experts. But I think it's not responsible,"" the president said. Biden warned about potential surges, citing the jumps in European nations that have reopened, and reiterated that vaccinations need to increase before businesses can reopen fully. ""We have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccinel, so we diminish the possibility for it to spread,"" he said. The seven-day average of new daily cases in Texas has decreased from 7,693 to 3,667 between March 1 and April 1, according to  . As of Sunday, 28% of Texas residents have received one vaccine dose, and 16% are fully vaccinated, according to the  . Nationally, about 32% of adults have received one shot, and roughly 18% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC."

While Rondo had just 2 points, 3 rebounds and 4 turnovers as he plays on a minutes restriction after returning from an adductor injury, George can see all the intangibles Rondo brings. George said Rondo's impact as a playmaker can help him and           the way           helped George when the two were in          . ""I think we can reserve more energy,"" George said of how he and Leonard can benefit from Rondo. ""I relate it to the relationship I have with Russ. Russ created a lot of closeout situations for me. And so it'll be the same thing with Rondo. Rondo can get to the middle of the paint, he can make plays. And a lot of times, he's going to create closeout situations for us."" George said Rondo, who won a championship with the           in 2008 and the Lakers last season, instantly becomes one of the respected leaders in the Clippers' locker room. ""Rondo's a leader, you know the point guard, he's a leader,"" George said. ""We're going to listen to him. I look at him as a leader, a leader of this group. He'll hold a lot of weight. He holds a lot of weight in the locker room. As he gets more comfortable within our system, getting games under his feet, he'll hold us accountable. That's what you need in the locker room, somebody that's going to say what needs to be said and get us going."" The Clippers traded           for Rondo in hopes that he will improve the leadership, basketball IQ and chemistry and orchestrate the offense -- all areas the Clippers were lacking in last postseason. Rondo came off the bench Sunday and had a turnover in his first play, but he got a steal three seconds later and dished his first assist by finding           for a 3 late in the first quarter. Clippers coach Ty Lue said Rondo looked rusty as expected as he played in his first game since March 22, when the           played the Clippers. Rondo said he has split his time on the court trying to learn the Clippers playbook and in the training room recovering from his adductor injury. Lue said Rondo has worked the locker room in trying to find out where teammates want the ball, including talking to Leonard and George on how to make things easier for them. He was asked if he had identified which areas the Clippers need to improve to win a championship. ""I can't dissect it that quickly,"" Rondo said. ""Obviously, I want to be around and continue to learn my teammates, learn what the coach asks of us as players. I can't really say exactly, pinpoint one thing that needs to be done here. I want to come here, help this team out as much as possible, lead in every way that's possible, and obviously we have one common goal."" Lue said he could see Rondo already improving the Clippers' pace and believes he will help get them into offensive sets quicker and get Leonard and George into easier spots to score. ""He's going to be a key piece to our run,"" said          , who had 22 points in the win. ""It's going to help us tremendously. It's going to help our superstars by getting them easier shots and getting them in their spots and even defensively just knowing where to be."" ""He played with my brother [          ] last year, and my brother had nothing but good things to say about him as a teammate. So we're just excited to get him, and I think he's really going to be a big factor in us trying to hang that banner."""

Angels manager Joe Maddon said Ohtani won't be in the starting lineup Monday against the visiting           , but it doesn't sound as if the scare will preclude Maddon from continuing to use Ohtani aggressively.

""He had great stuff,"" Maddon added. ""I don't believe in the third-time-through stuff. It depends on what the pitcher has. I don't think any of those hitters had good swings at him. Did they hit any balls hard? He did walk a couple guys, there's no question, but his stuff was still premium. ""He had great stuff, and that's the part of a player's situation that he can really, mentally, become something even more special than he is by fighting through that moment. So, I totally disagree with that evaluation. That was his spot. He had great stuff, I had a lot of confidence in him, and the ball that gets past the catcher is strike three, which would have been an entirely different outcome."" Instead, it was a sour end to a thrilling night for Ohtani, who began it by throwing a baseball 101 mph in the top of the first inning and hitting a baseball 115 mph in the bottom of the first. Ohtani's 100.6 mph pitch to          , which helped set up his first strikeout, was the fastest-thrown pitch by any starting pitcher this season. And Ohtani's home run, which carried an exit velocity of 115.2 mph, was the hardest-hit homer of the season by any player. Ohtani, 26, finished 1-for-3 at the plate, including a lineout to center and a hard groundout up the middle. On the mound, he was charged with three runs (one earned) on two hits, five walks and seven strikeouts in 4⅔ innings. He threw eight pitches at least 100 mph, one more than he had accumulated in 12 prior major league starts. Ohtani became the first starting pitcher to bat second in a game since Jack Dunleavy in 1903, and it sounds as if that will be the norm this season. Maddon believes juggling both disciplines brings out more of Ohtani's personality. ""I think you're seeing him for the first time,"" Maddon said. ""I'm absolutely seeing Shohei as he is, as he functions as a human. There's no barriers. ""He wanted to stay in for one more guy after he fell to the ground, and I said, 'No, that's about right there, brother.' I think he was at early 90 number of pitches, which was right about our threshold. Man, that's how a guy becomes a guy. You gotta give him that opportunity."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-searching-answers-losing/story?id=76874093,sports," star guard           couldn't hide his frustration after his team's latest setback, a 117-111 loss to the           on Sunday night. It's the Warriors' seventh defeat in its last eight games. ""It's tough,"" Curry said, when asked about how his younger teammates are dealing with all the losing. ""Keep it real, we all had higher expectations for where we were supposed to be this season. And guys want to out-perform; when they go out there they want to exceed the expectations for themselves, for the coaching staff, whatever it is. And when it doesn't happen, it's frustrating. ""I hope it stings. I hope it's uncomfortable. I hope it motivates you to keep grinding, challenging yourself to get better. I hope nobody is content just being in this middle of the road situation. We're going to find out how we respond down the stretch of the season. See what we're made of."" The blunt honesty was telling considering the 33-year-old usually likes to remain even-keeled in his regular assessments of the team. Curry dropped 37 points but didn't get enough help around him to close a game in which the Hawks bench outscored the Warriors bench 55-19. ""You cannot play the way that we've played the last significant stretch and expect things to change,"" Curry said. ""So it kind of is what it is. We got to make the necessary adjustments. It sucks right now. Losing sucks. It's a terrible feeling in the locker room. We don't really have much to smile about. And it's kind of the vibe right now."" What seems to be wearing on Curry more than usual is the fact that despite his high level play, he is left to answer the same questions about his team that nobody on the roster has an answer for -- notably, why does the group continue making the same mistakes over and over again? The Warriors had more fouls (26) than assists (25) on Sunday night. ""I don't know, man,"" Curry said of the fouling. ""It's like the 20th time we get asked that question and we haven't figured it out, so it's on all of us to hold each other accountable to the details of being in the right position."" Kerr echoed a similar sentiment. ""If I knew, I would give you the answer,"" Kerr said. ""We talk about it every day. We talked about it before the game, we talked about it at halftime, but it's as simple as that. We lost because we fouled over and over and over again."" On top of the losses, which continue to pile up as the Warriors sit at a season-worst 23-27 record, is the fact that Curry is still dealing with a painful tailbone injury that caused him to sit out Friday night's embarrassing 53 point loss to the          . Curry said the injury is ""slowly"" getting better, pointing out that he only fell on his tailbone once on Sunday. The broader bottom line for the Warriors is that the proud organization is dealing with a dose of reality that is getting heavier throughout the season. Even when Curry is playing at an MVP level, it's still not enough on some nights to pull out wins. After years of reigning at the top of the NBA, it's a difficult pill for the two-time MVP to swallow. ""The hard part is trying to answer some of the questions around how we can get better and how we win games,"" Curry said. ""The situation is what it is. We have a lot to improve on, and there's a challenge there that we all need to take head on. It's uncomfortable right now, it's frustrating for everybody, but it will test us to find a way to make these last 20 games matter and give us something to show for it towards the end of the season. ""Right now, it's frustrating for sure. I hope everybody in the locker room hates losing as a motivation just to stick with it, to stay connected and to figure it out."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/los-angeles-angels-star-shohei-ohtani-limps-off/story?id=76872987,sports,"ANAHEIM, Calif. -- An exhilarating start to a historic night ended in potential injury for          , who exited his outing after taking a           cleat to his left ankle in Sunday's fifth inning. Moments later, a           spokesman said Ohtani is ""fine"" and that he wasn't removed from his start because of injury. Ohtani, hitting on the same day of his start for the first time in his major league career, was left in to face           with the bases loaded, two outs and Ohtani's command seemingly wavering. Ohtani struck out Moncada in the seventh pitch of the at-bat, but Angels catcher           failed to corral a splitter, ultimately prompting Ohtani to cover home and get clipped by Abreu as he slid in to score the third           run. Ohtani limped off the field, exiting his start with 92 pitches and paving the way for           to finish the top of the fifth. The Angels said Ohtani will be re-evaluated on Monday. It was a sour end to an exhilarating night for Ohtani, who began it by throwing a baseball 101 mph in the top of the first and hitting a baseball 115 mph in the bottom of the first. Ohtani's 100.6 mph pitch to          , which helped set up his first strikeout, was the fastest-thrown pitch of any starting pitcher this season. And his home run, which carried an exit velocity of 115.2 mph, was the hardest-hit home run of the season by any player. Ohtani officially finished 1-for-3, including a lineout to center field and a hard groundout up the middle. On the mound, he was charged with three runs (only one of them earned) on two hits and five walks in 4 2/3 innings, striking out seven. The 26-year-old right-hander was dominant through the first four innings, throwing numerous triple-digit fastballs while also showcasing a nasty splitter and a wipeout slider. He retired two of the first three batters he faced in the fifth -- helped by a diving catch from right fielder           -- but issued back-to-back walks to Adam Eaton and Abreu, then uncorked a wild pitch to lose the shutout. Six pitches after that came the dropped third strike from Stassi, the throw to first, and Abreu coming around to score. The Angels hope it doesn't result in a serious injury for Ohtani, who became the first starting pitcher to bat second in a game since Jack Dunleavy in 1903."

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/stanford-holds-off-arizona-ncaa-womens-basketball-championship/story?id=76873190,sports,"SAN ANTONIO --           coach Tara VanDerveer grinned as she left her post-championship news conference, saying, ""I've got 600 text messages!"" The last time VanDerveer and the Cardinal won the NCAA women's basketball title, it was eight months before the very first text message was ever sent. That 1992 championship was Stanford's second in three years. No one could have imagined how long it would be before the Cardinal won a third. And after a 29-year wait, Stanford still had to sweat through 6.1 pressure-packed seconds on Sunday to claim its trophy,           when           star guard Aari McDonald missed a shot just before the buzzer. VanDerveer couldn't exhale until that moment. ""That's the way basketball is,"" VanDerveer said. ""If you've got a faint heart or weak stomach, then don't coach."" VanDerveer has been doing that at the Division I level since 1978, when she started her head-coaching career at Idaho. After a stint at Ohio State, she took over at Stanford in 1985-86 and won her first NCAA title in 1990. She has won or shared 24 Pac-12 regular-season titles and won 14 of that league's 20 tournaments. But now, finally, the Cardinal are on top of the women's basketball world again. The 29-year gap between NCAA titles is the longest for any Division I coach in any sport. ""This program is what it is because of Tara,"" said Stanford sophomore Haley Jones, who had 17 points on Sunday and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. ""The legacy she's created, just being able to be recruited by her, now be a part of the team, and then to take that a step further and win a national championship after the 29-year-long drought. ""I don't think it's still honestly even hit me yet. Even standing with the confetti, I'm just still waiting for it to kick in."" The No. 1 overall seed in the tournament, Stanford leaves the Alamodome as champion, but Arizona leaves as an underdog team that captured the country's imagination and almost the program's first NCAA title. Both teams struggled offensively, a credit to mutually strong defenses. The Wildcats shot just 28.8% from the field but still took the game to the buzzer in large part by forcing 21 Stanford turnovers. McDonald, one of the individual stars of the tournament, said of her final shot, ""I got denied hard. I tried to turn the corner, they sent three [defenders] at me. I took a tough, contested shot. Didn't fall, so ..."" ""It doesn't come down to the last possession; it comes down to all the little things,"" said Arizona coach Adia Barnes, who was trying to lead her alma mater to a title in just her first NCAA tournament as head coach. ""The margin of error is so slim in a championship game. This is uncharted territory for the Wildcats."" But it's oh-so-familiar territory for VanDerveer and the Cardinal. Between their last title and Sunday's championship, the Cardinal had 10 other trips to the Final Four, all of which ended without the trophy. That included semifinal losses in 1995, 1996 and 1997, although VanDerveer wasn't with the 1996 team because she was coaching the U.S. national team in preparation for the 1996 Olympics, which the Americans won. Stanford went to five consecutive Final Fours from 2008 to 2012, losing in the 2008 and 2010 championship games to Tennessee and UConn, respectively. Even with sisters Nneka and Chiney Ogwumike, both future No. 1 WNBA draft picks, the Cardinal couldn't break through. ""I really feel like we won this for all of the great players that have played at Stanford,"" VanDerveer said. ""I know that these women are kind of on the shoulders of those women. Former players would be so proud to be part of this team because of the resilience they've shown, because of the sisterhood that they represent."" This season alone has been quite a journey for VanDerveer and the Cardinal. The team was forced on the road for nearly 10 weeks because of COVID-19 regulations in California's Santa Clara County, spending 86 days in hotels. It prepared the Cardinal for the past three weeks in the NCAA tournament bubble in San Antonio. In December, VanDerveer earned her 1,099th career victory to pass the late Tennessee coach Pat Summitt for most in Division I women's basketball history, and she now has 1,125, with 973 at Stanford. VanDerveer is tied with Baylor's Kim Mulkey at three NCAA titles, behind 11 for UConn's Geno Auriemma and eight for Summitt. Auriemma's Huskies defeated Stanford the last time the Cardinal reached the NCAA title game, in 2010, and he is second behind VanDerveer in career victories. ""It's truly amazing when you think of what it takes to put yourself in position to win a championship in four decades,"" Auriemma told ESPN on Sunday about VanDerveer. ""Her consistency is remarkable, and I admire how well she has handled all that goes with it."" No other Division I coach has gone more than 20 years between titles. In women's basketball, the next-longest gap is 17 years (Muffet McGraw, 2001 and 2018 at Notre Dame). The longest gap for men's basketball is also 17 years (Rick Pitino, 1996 at Kentucky and 2013 at Louisville, although that title was later vacated). VanDerveer will turn 68 in June, and she admitted it was a taxing season with the pandemic. But she has another strong recruiting class coming in and said she really hasn't thought about retirement. ""Maybe I'll think about it later,"" she said. ""Right now, I am very excited about what we accomplished, about the team that we have in that locker room and the young people that are committed to Stanford. I'm happy. I'm enjoying it. ""Sometimes, you just have to stick with things. For me as a coach, again, you want to win a national championship. We have had shots at it. I've had heartbreak with teams that had great shots of winning it. But this team won, and I'm so proud of them."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-swipes-trump-administration-unveiling-human-rights-report/story?id=76770342,politics,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken repudiated the Trump administration's approach to human rights, with his most direct condemnation of his predecessor yet. Blinken launched the department's 45th annual human rights report Tuesday -- the gold standard in documenting abuses and atrocities in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. The report, which covers 2020, found a further deterioration for human rights in many countries, particularly as governments used the   pandemic to curb their citizens' rights. The first report under the Biden administration also   that eliminated   of the Trump years, like ending former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's ""hierarchy"" of rights and re-introducing a section on women's reproductive rights that will be published later this year. When human rights defenders ""come under attack, they often look to the United States to speak up on their behalf. Too often in recent years, these defenders heard only silence from us,"" Blinken said. ""We are back for those brave advocates as well. We will not be silent."" In particular, Blinken ""decisively"" repudiated Pompeo's ""Unalienable Rights Commission,"" a panel of academics that said in a report last July that freedom of religion and right to property were the most important human rights. While Pompeo touted the report and said it would lay a foundation for future administrations, critics accused it of minimizing minority rights. Blinken essentially jettisoned the report, saying Tuesday, ""There is no hierarchy that makes some rights more important than others. Past unbalanced statements that suggest such a hierarchy, including those offered by a recently disbanded State Department advisory committee, do not represent a guiding document for this administration."" Human rights are increasingly under threat around the world, Blinken said, saying the trendlines ""are in the wrong direction."" In particular, he highlighted what he called the Chinese   of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province, attacks on civil society and   in Russia, Uganda and Venezuela and on pro-democracy protesters in Belarus,   in Yemen, atrocities ""credibly reported"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region, and abuses by the Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime. While the report doesn't touch on Myanmar's coup and the military's bloody  , because they happened in 2021, Blinken took time to again condemn the events. But after weeks of steadily increasing U.S. sanctions that have not deterred the ruling junta, he had no specific answer on what else the U.S. could do to change the darkening trajectory there. Blinken also leaned into America's own human rights issues, particularly the moment of racial reckoning in the last year. Chinese officials and state-run outlets   U.S. race relations to say American officials are in no position to criticize Beijing -- comparing Uighur slave labor in Xinjiang to Black slaves in the U.S. South. ""We know we have work to do at home. That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism. We don't pretend these problems don't exist. ... We deal with them in the daylight with full transparency, and in fact, that's exactly what separates our democracy and autocracies,"" he said, adding that open reckoning gives the U.S. ""greater legitimacy"" to address other countries' records, too. The Biden administration will use all tools available to impose consequences on human rights abusers and encourage better behavior, Blinken said,   Khashoggi policy that imposes visa restrictions on officials that target or harass their countries' dissidents. ""Standing up for human rights everywhere is in America's interests, and the Biden-Harris administration will stand against human rights abuses wherever they occur, regardless of whether the perpetrators are adversaries or partners,"" he said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-matt-gaetz-denies-sexual-relationship-underage-girl/story?id=76780776,politics,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Tuesday denied that he had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl amid new reports that the Justice Department was investigating the alleged relationship -- claiming the probe was part of an elaborate extortion scheme. The investigation, first reported by The New York Times, began last summer and focuses on whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with an underage girl and paid for her to travel with him, and whether he violated federal sex trafficking laws, a source aware of the investigation confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz told the Times that his lawyers were informed that he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" The New York Times reported that the inquiry into Gaetz is part of a larger inquiry into Joel Greenberg, a former Florida official indicted last summer on charges that included sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex. Greenberg has pleaded not guilty. On Fox News, Gaetz -- who, according to an Axios report earlier on Tuesday, had been telling confidants he was considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax -- appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. McGee did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. In an interview with the Washington Post, McGee denied Gaetz's claim that he was part of an extortion effort targeting the Florida congressman. ""It is completely false. It's a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he's under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,"" McGee told the Post. ""I have no connection with that case at all, other than, one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors."" ""I do believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to smear me,"" Gaetz said on Fox News. In a statement from his office, Gaetz said he had been cooperating with authorities and that his father ""has even been wearing a wire"" at the FBI's direction ""to catch these criminals"" seeking to extort him for $25 million. Asked in the Fox News interview how long the investigation had been going on, Gaetz said ""I don't know,"" and went on to suggest that someone is alleging there are ""pictures of me with child prostitutes,"" which he claimed was ""obviously false."" At one point during the interview, Gaetz claimed that two years ago he had dinner with Carlson and took along  a ""friend"" who was ""actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn't cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme that she could face trouble."" But Carlson promptly denied knowing what Gaetz was talking about, responding: ""I don't remember the woman you're speaking of or the context at all, honestly."" After returning from a commercial break, Carlson called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."""

The groups are suing in federal court on behalf of a church and other community groups. ""The elections were celebrated not just for their turnout, but also for their integrity, with Georgia officials praising them as safe and secure,"" the release said. ""But rather than act to expand participation in the political process, Georgia leaders responded by doing what they have done many times in the state's history: they placed burdensome, unjustified, and unnecessary restrictions on voters, particularly voters of color and other historically disenfranchised communities."" Sophia Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, pinned the motives of the law on race. ""This law is driven by blatant racism, represents politics at its very worst, and is clearly illegal,"" Lakin said in the statement. ""We urge the court to act swiftly to strike it down."" Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defended the law from criticism last week, saying that critics -- including President Joe Biden -- hadn't read the law. ""This bill expands voting access, streamlines vote-counting procedures, and ensures election integrity,"" Kemp said in a tweeted statement.

In a statement Friday, he likened it to ""Jim Crow"" laws and called on Congress to pass a Democratic-supported federal measure to protect voting rights. ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the   Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Prominent Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams released a statement about the law shortly after it was passed last week. ""Every business, political, and civic leader must stand up and make their opposition to these desperate anti-democratic laws clear,"" Abrams said.

Please,"" Biden said Monday. ""This is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously -- precisely what got us in this mess in the first place -- risks more cases and more ... deaths."" Biden's call for the American people to continue using masks to stop COVID from surging is nothing new. He has made the plea in nearly all of his remarks on the virus as president, warning that the country is not yet out the woods even as progress is made on vaccinations. Also on Monday, he announced at least 90% of Americans would be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, and 90% of the population would have a vaccination site within 5 miles of their homes. But the rollback on restrictions at the state level highlights the competing challenge Biden faces on the pandemic: touting positive signs that hope is on the horizon, while also keeping a country fatigued of COVID-19 regulations and restrictions compliant. White House COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also had a warning for states Tuesday. ""Lifting all of these restrictions, telling people not to wear masks, gathering in large crowds, that's the equivalent of playing with fire."" Despite the administration's dire warnings, Republican leaders moved forward with plans to do away with statewide mandates on masking. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who last previously extended her state's mask mandate through the end of March, made clear she has no intention of issuing another extension. ""As Gov. Ivey has previously stated, Alabama's mask mandate ends April 9. We have made progress, and we are moving towards personal responsibility and common sense, not endless government mandates,"" Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said in a statement to the Associated Press. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has also previously extended his state's masking requirement, announced Tuesday his plans to immediately lift the mandate. ""This does not mean that the use of the mask will cease,"" Hutchinson argued, adding that ""common sense should govern"" mask usage and private businesses' decisions on masks should still be respected. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who recently signed a bill repealing the state's mask mandate starting April 10, also has no plans to reverse course, his office confirmed to ABC News. In her press briefing Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki sidestepped questions about the impact Biden's message was having, arguing that local leaders and businesses could take action even if governors refused to do so. ""It's a tough message, (but) important for people to hear that we're still in war with this virus, and people need to still be vigilant in order to return to normal,"" Psaki said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now seeing an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases and people hospitalized with the disease, according to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, caused by increased travel in recent weeks, lifting restrictions and more relaxed behavior. The seven-day average of cases has seen a 10% increase over the previous period and hospitalizations and deaths also have increased. ""I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,"" Walensky said in an emotional plea at a White House briefing Monday. ""We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now, I'm scared."""

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-searching-answers-losing/story?id=76874095,sports," star guard           couldn't hide his frustration after his team's latest setback, a           at the           on Sunday night. It was the Warriors' seventh defeat in their past eight games. ""It's tough,"" Curry said, when asked about how his younger teammates are dealing with all the losing. ""Keep it real; we all had higher expectations for where we were supposed to be this season. And guys want to outperform; when they go out there, they want to exceed the expectations for themselves, for the coaching staff, whatever it is. And when it doesn't happen, it's frustrating. ""I hope it stings. I hope it's uncomfortable. I hope it motivates you to keep grinding, challenging yourself to get better. I hope nobody is content just being in this middle-of-the-road situation. We're going to find out how we respond down the stretch of the season. See what we're made of."" The blunt honesty was telling considering the 33-year-old usually likes to remain even-keeled in his regular assessments of the team. Curry dropped 37 points but didn't get enough help around him to close a game in which the Hawks' bench outscored the Warriors' bench 55-19. ""You cannot play the way that we've played the last significant stretch and expect things to change,"" Curry said. ""So it kind of is what it is. We got to make the necessary adjustments. It sucks right now. Losing sucks. It's a terrible feeling in the locker room. We don't really have much to smile about. And it's kind of the vibe right now."" What seems to be wearing on Curry more than usual is that despite his high-level play, he is left to answer the same questions about his team that nobody on the roster has an answer for -- notably, why does the group continue making the same mistakes over and over again? The Warriors had more fouls (26) than assists (25) on Sunday night. ""I don't know, man,"" Curry said of the fouling. ""It's like the 20th time we get asked that question, and we haven't figured it out, so it's on all of us to hold each other accountable to the details of being in the right position."" Warriors coach Steve Kerr echoed the sentiment. ""If I knew, I would give you the answer,"" Kerr said. ""We talk about it every day. We talked about it before the game, we talked about it at halftime, but it's as simple as that. We lost because we fouled over and over and over again."" On top of the losses, which continue to pile up as the Warriors (23-27) sit at a season-worst four games under .500, Curry is still dealing with a painful tailbone injury that caused him to sit out Friday night's embarrassing, 53-point road loss to the          . Curry said the injury is ""slowly"" getting better, pointing out that he only fell on his tailbone once on Sunday. The broader bottom line for the Warriors is that the proud organization is dealing with a dose of reality that is getting heavier throughout the season. Even when Curry is playing at an MVP level, it's still not enough on some nights to pull out wins. After years of reigning at the top of the NBA, it's a difficult pill for the two-time MVP to swallow. ""The hard part is trying to answer some of the questions around how we can get better and how we win games,"" Curry said. ""The situation is what it is. We have a lot to improve on, and there's a challenge there that we all need to take head on. It's uncomfortable right now, it's frustrating for everybody, but it will test us to find a way to make these last 20 games matter and give us something to show for it towards the end of the season. ""Right now, it's frustrating, for sure. I hope everybody in the locker room hates losing as a motivation just to stick with it, to stay connected and to figure it out."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/older-americans-largely-vaccinated-covid-19-cases-younger/story?id=76777363,politics,"As more older Americans get vaccinated an increasing number of new   cases are impacting younger adults,   that   in an effort to prevent more people from becoming sick. The number of new COVID-19 cases increased more than 10% in 26 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico since last week, a possible signal that the country is on the  . And for the first time, the majority of new hospitalizations have been younger adults, with cases among people ages 50-65 increasing more than those older than 65, who are more likely to have been vaccinated. And in some states, like Michigan and Massachusetts, the number of cases among older children, teenagers and young adults have also increased. At the same time recent data showed a 96% decline in COVID-19 cases in nursing homes since the vaccine rollout began in December, indicating high vaccination rates are helping protect older populations. Dr. Nick Gilpin, chief medical officer for Beaumont Health system in Michigan, said the average age of their COVID-19 patients is 46 years old. ""A lot of these individuals have been doing all of those things that we’ve been warning about: gathering together in large groups, going to bars and restaurants,"" he told ABC News. Public   experts say a more serious spike in cases can still be prevented, but only if everyone doubles down on protections like wearing masks, avoiding indoor gatherings, refraining from nonessential travel and getting vaccinated as soon as possible. ""I so badly want to be done. I know you all so badly want to be done. We are just almost there, but not quite yet,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in  Walensky and other public health officials said cases are increasing because people began to relax their behavior while there was still a lot of the virus spreading in the country, particularly newer variants that can spread more easily. As more states have relaxed restrictions and more people have been traveling, the virus has taken advantage of more opportunities to spread. ""The rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases in teens and young adults is very troubling. Tragically, states -- like Massachusetts -- ignored the advice of public health officials and re-opened too quickly,"" said Sam Scarpino, an assistant professor in the emerging epidemics lab at Northeastern University. ""As a result we're at risk, entering another surge and delaying our safe return to normalcy,"" Scarpino added. Twenty-six states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have seen an increase of over 10% in the number of new cases since last week. New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Connecticut currently hold the highest case rates per 100,000 people over the last seven days. Hospital admissions are also increasing in nearly a dozen states. As more states push to reopen schools and businesses the increased activity also creates more opportunities for the virus to spread among younger groups that have thus far not been seen as at high risk for severe illness. ""Not many states make age data available over time, but in the few that do, older children -- 10-19 -- and young adults are making up a larger fraction of the cases. This likely reflects a combination of widespread vaccination among older adults and increased mobility among young people, through school reopening and more community activities,"" said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Rivers said a new surge among younger adults wouldn't necessarily lead to increases in hospitalizations and deaths like the trend with  . ""Through most of the pandemic, hospitalizations and deaths have tracked closely with cases. But now that nearly three in four people over the age of 65 have had at least one dose of the vaccine, we’ll start to see that change. I expect that even in places where cases surge, we won’t see as many severe cases as we would have six months ago,"" she said. But Walensky and other public health officials said even if a ""fourth surge"" in cases affects more younger adults, they're still concerned about any increase in how much the virus is spreading. ""There are plenty of reasons to not want to have COVID outside of just the deaths alone,"" Walensky said in an interview on MSNBC on Monday night. ""We know that about 10% of the population that gets sick with COVID has long haul syndrome, has symptoms beyond three weeks, cardiac challenges, depression and mental health challenges, pulmonary challenges, renal failure, clotting. So there's a lot we don't understand about this disease, and we shouldn't want to have it circulating whether or not it leads to mortality,"" she continued."

But President Joe Biden's two-phase   will carry a larger price tag along with potentially greater implications. The president is set to start outlining his proposal Wednesday in Pittsburgh -- the same city where he   -- in the midst of a defining challenge to his vow to ""change the paradigm."" The action will be primarily, if not exclusively, inside his own party. Both Biden and Democratic congressional leaders are   Republican buy-in, and they know that even bending or changing Senate rules only matters if Democrats are almost entirely on board with the plan. That plan will include billions upon billions for things like roads, bridges and broadband. Billions more would flow toward what progressives have categorized as ""human infrastructure"" -- paid family leave, college access, housing, elder care -- all while seeking to deliver on climate-change and social-justice goals.

Biden's proposals will be scored, amended and picked apart. But if he is to make good on what he's promising, he'll need to navigate complex intra-party dynamics to get to the payoff. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is doubling down on the sweeping voting legislation he   last week as the fallout from it continues. Calls to boycott Georgia-based companies are growing and the arrest of a Black state lawmaker inflamed an already fierce response. In an interview with Atlanta   Tuesday, Kemp criticized his opponents who describe the law as voter suppression that disproportionately impacts voters of color. He dismissed organizations pointing to Georgia's record of discriminatory voting practices and diminished   about equitable access to the ballot box as a form of  ""cancel culture."" ""I knew what was coming from the other side. I knew that they were going to try to do this boycott, cancel culture and everything else,"" Kemp said.

In the lawsuit, James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, who has served as a Capitol Police officer for 11 years, quote Trump's words leading up to the riot, including Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud and his assertion that Democrats were ""trying to steal"" the  . The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., demands an award of at least $75,000 for each officer for each of the five alleged counts against Trump, as well as punitive damages and costs associated with the litigation. The counts include directing assault and battery, aiding and abetting assault and battery, directing intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violating D.C. statutes against incitement of a riot and disorderly conduct. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Officer Blassingame was one of ""eight or nine"" officers who rioters confronted in the crypt of the  , directly below the rotunda, the suit alleges. ""The insurrectionists were throwing items, and striking Officer Blassingame and the other USCP officers with their fists and weapons,"" the complaint alleges, as a ""front line of insurrectionists was being pressed from behind by waves of newly arriving insurrectionists."" A ""forceful surge of insurrectionists pushed forward and slammed Officer Blassingame against a stone column,"" striking his spine and the back of his head, leaving him ""unable to move,"" the suit alleges. ""Foremost in Officer Blassingame's mind was the terrifying certainty that the insurrectionists were interested in him and the other officers not going home to their families that night,"" the lawsuit claims. The suit also makes a claim similar to what Capitol Police officer   told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas about the racial slurs hurled at officers who were on duty that day. ""For the first time in [Officer Blassingame's] life, people were yelling into his face, calling him a [n-word] repeatedly and throughout the attack in the crypt. He lost count of the many times the racial slur was hurled at him,"" the suit alleges. The allegations in the suit paint an ugly, violent and vivid picture of the attacks it says Blassingame endured. ""The insurrectionists struck Officer Blassingame in his face, head, chest, arms, and what felt like every part of his body,"" it says. ""Insurrectionists used their fists and had weapons that ranged from flagpoles to stanchions and building directional signs, water bottles and other objects he could not identify."" Blassingame's ""sole focus was to do what he could to survive,"" the suit claims. Blassingame alleges that he suffered back and head injuries and ""is haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts -- the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface."" The suit also alleges that Blassingame ""experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked; and of surviving where other colleagues did not."" Following the attack, Blassingame ""was not able to sleep,"" claims the suit, and he allegedly suffered from ""depression that he could not address because he was too consumed with a sense of continued obligation to continue on with his professional responsibilities."" Because he continues to work in the Capitol, ""he is unable to avoid most of the triggers of his emotional reactions,"" the suit claims. Officer Hemby, the suit alleges, was ""crushed against the doors on the east side trying to hold the insurrectionists back,"" and that the rioters ""continued to scream, 'Fight for Trump,' 'Stop the steal,' and various other slogans, as they struck him with their fists and whatever they had in their hands."" Hemby also endured being ""sprayed with chemicals that irritated his eyes, skin, and throat,"" the suit alleges. The suit alleges Hemby was ""bleeding from a cut located less than an inch from his eye"" and that he ""had cuts and abrasions on his face and hands, and his body was pinned against a large metal door."" As a result of the attack, the suit claims that Hemby's ""left hand and left knee became swollen and painful,"" and that he suffers from back and neck pain and that his skin was burned from being ""sprayed in the face and body with chemical sprays."" Hemby also claims in the suit that he now suffers from trouble sleeping. The lawsuit cites a litany of Trump's tweets and public statements leading up to the attack, including his call for a ""wild"" protest on Jan. 6 and his promotion of ""the baseless idea that Vice President Mike Pence could single-handedly reject the election outcome based on false claims that some states wanted to 'decertify' or 'correct' election results that were not in Trump's favor."" The suit also cites the words of a number of prominent Republican lawmakers who place the blame for the riot on Trump, including Sen. Mitt Romney, Rep. Liz Cheney and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who after voting to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting the insurrection, took to the Senate floor on Feb. 13 and made clear his belief that Trump was responsible for the Capitol riot. ""There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said. ""The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president, and having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth."" What McConnell said next is also cited in the suit, in support of how Trump may still be held accountable for his actions even though he's no longer in office. ""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn't get away with anything yet -- yet,"" McConnell said. ""We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one."""

A growing backlog inflamed by the coronavirus pandemic has caused delays for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency responsible for housing children after they are apprehended by Border Patrol. Representatives from the press were allowed inside a temporary tent facility in Donna, Texas, which was meant to hold 250 migrants but had a population of more than 4,100 as of Tuesday. Of those, 3,400 were unaccompanied minors and more than 2,000 have waited beyond the legal limit of 72 hours, according to Customs and Border Protection. The video shows children and families packed into tight living quarters, sleeping on gray camping mats with mylar blankets for warmth. In transparent, plastic pods there is hardly room to walk with young children crammed shoulder to shoulder. Journalists also saw a fenced in recreation area where two groups of boys were playing soccer, agents in dark sunglasses watching over them. The facility spans 184,000 square feet and requires a staff of more than 500 agents. It takes $16 million per month to run the facility. ""As I have said repeatedly, a Border Patrol facility is no place for a child,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Tuesday. ""We have been working around the clock, in coordination with HHS, to quickly move unaccompanied children out of these crowded Border Patrol stations and into the care of HHS so they can be placed with family members or other sponsors."" Earlier Tuesday morning, U.S. Border Patrol took a small group of journalists along dirt roads near the borderline, where they observed the arrest of migrants who had surrendered to authorities prior to their likely transfer to the Donna processing center. All unaccompanied children who are apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley are brought to the Donna facility where they receive a health screening and wait to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. CBP also takes temperatures as they arrive and refers them to additional health checks if they have a fever. Acting Executive Officer for Rio Grande Valley Operational Programs Division Oscar Escamilla showed reporters through the facility on Tuesday. ""Yes we are officers. Yes we enforce the   laws,"" Escamilla said. ""But when you have kids involved, we have to take care of these kids. This is not the right place for these kids."" Escamilla said children are offered the opportunity to call family members at least once every 48 hours while they are in the facility. The new administration took swift actions right from the start to reverse several immigration policies of the Trump era. While the new White House has come under fire for pulling back hard-line restrictions before it was fully prepared to handle the current surge of migrants, some remain in place. Biden administration officials are quick to point out one major departure from Trump’s pandemic-era immigration restrictions: the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children. When the Trump administration invoked a section of the public health code known as ""Title 42"" it gave immigration authorities the green light to start rapidly removing unaccompanied migrant children. Mostly in their teens, kids at the time were sent back to Mexico sometimes within a matter of hours. Customs and Border Protection said it was necessary to reduce overcrowding at its facilities. Legal advocates for immigrants have decried the use of Title 42 as illegal and unnecessarily cruel. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has taken on the responsibility of processing and caring for children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. The change, combined with an unprecedented increase in the number of kids found crossing the border, has strained government resources and sent the Biden administration scrambling to find more shelter space. Federal officials have enlisted convention centers in California and Texas, and even co-opted a NASA site for the mass housing effort. The difference in the application of the Title 42 so-called health mandates is also seen with migrant families who cross the border. Thousands have been turned back or ""expelled"" under the Biden administration, but the majority in recent weeks have remained in the U.S. for traditional immigration processing. Last February, nearly 20,000 migrant families were stopped at the border by U.S. immigration authorities. Of those, nearly 8,000 were rapidly ""expelled"" under Title 42. U.S. officials have said immigration officials on the other side of the border, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, have refused to accept families with children under the age of 7."

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fda-authorizes-rapid-prescription-covid-19-tests/story?id=76798644,politics,"More Americans will soon be able to purchase over-the-counter rapid coronavirus tests without a prescription at their local pharmacy or retail store following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s authorization of two more at-home tests that are easy to buy and perform. The FDA on Thursday authorized BinaxNOW, a COVID-19 antigen self-test by Abbott, a U.S. COVID-19 testing manufacturing company. It also authorized the Quick Vue test by Quidel, a diagnostic health care product manufacturer. Neither requires a prescription. Abbott says its COVID-19 antigen self-test will be available to individuals with or without symptoms. ""Together with vaccines, the BinaxNOW self-test will help Americans get back to doing what they want and need to do -- like going to work and school or seeing friends and family -- with greater confidence,"" said Robert Ford, Abbott’s president and chief executive officer. Abbott’s rapid test initially required a health care provider to administer the swab and solution-based test kit, and then it was authorized for at-home use with a virtual proctor watching the process, which was included with the $25 fee. This new FDA authorization allows an individual to perform the test themselves, without a doctor’s prescription and at a lower cost. An Abbott spokesperson told ABC News the tests are expected to be sold in packs of two and will cost under $10 dollars per test. The spokesperson also said the test should be available in the coming weeks. Users will only need to perform a minimally invasive nasal swab, not the deeper nasal swaps common in some PCR tests and can expect results in about 15 minutes, accordiing to the company. Quidel's test is designed for self-collected nasal swabs for people 14 or older and for adult-collected specimens of children 2 years and up. Rapid antigen tests provide the advantage of lower costs, fewer supplies and speed than molecular PCR tests, which take one to two days for laboratory processing. PCR tests can detect lower levels of replicating virus, but antigen tests are intended to be accurate at detecting virus when a person is actively sick and most likely contagious.  of the accuracy of some rapid antigen tests and noted that they may be subject to false positive results – especially if there is not a lot of active virus in a specific community or if they are performed incorrectly. Proponents of rapid antigen tests point out the benefit of more people being able to identify when they are most contagious so they know to immediately isolate and not pass on the virus. Confirmation testing is still encouraged. ""The test performs at greater than 95% accuracy, and that’s the kind of level that we need to have the confidence to return to all the many things that we love to do,"" said Mary Rodgers, principal scientist at Abbott. ""We are prepared with our manufacturing to supply tens of million tests a month.""  said its test ""provides results in agreement with PCR 83.5% of the time when positive and 99.2% when negative."" The company did not indicate a timeline for the release of its tests. The influx of new tests comes as the nation faces a downward trend in the daily administration of COVID-19 tests, with health care workers now focused on distributing vaccine shots. The daily national COVID-19 testing rate is just over 1 million a day, according to  Public health experts argue that the low testing numbers are not where the nation needs to be to fully pull itself out of the pandemic, as the daily COVID-19 caseload creeps upward. ""The same people who are doing the testing are often the same ones doing the vaccinations,"" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. ""And the attention to some of the issues around supply may affect the focus turning to vaccines rather than tests."" With just about 17% of Americans now fully vaccinated, coronavirus testing remains an important tool in tracking new cases and putting a halt to spread. The FDA in March issued additional guidance for test developers seeking emergency use authorization of tests screening large groups of individuals for COVID-19 infections. It is guidance that could come in handy for employers and school administrators looking for protection from bouts of coronavirus infection. ""With the FDA’s authorization of multiple tests, the public can be assured these tests have met our scientific standards for emergency use authorization,"" said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. ""As we’ve said all along, if it’s a good test, we’ll authorize it."""

The   includes allegations by detainees that officers at the La Palma Correctional Center used excessive force and findings that some verbally abused detainees. Officials fired pepper spray at detainees and deployed chemical agents from the ceiling in order to stop a peaceful protest by detainees in April 2020, according to the report. While detainees describe this use of force as ""excessive,"" the report states that federal detention guidelines may not have been violated since they don't specify how ICE officers should respond to civil disobedience. An ICE official said the report's claims about detention standards were ""unsubstantiated."" ""ICE leadership is concerned that several findings in the report rely on uncorroborated allegations by detainees, such as when it appears that the audit team did not interview ICE or the contracting facility representatives,"" the official wrote in a letter to the inspector general. In a separate incident, a guard ridiculed a detainee with ""profane and abusive language,"" according to the report. Another officer allegedly used a racial slur directed at a detainee, threatened to use pepper spray on him and terminated his phone call with family. The report also found that protocols to stem the spread of COVID-19 were not enforced at the facility and some detainees did not receive masks despite a coronavirus outbreak in August of last year. There have been 767 coronavirus cases at the facility and currently 75 detainees are being isolated or monitored, according to ICE data. Detainees also faced delays in receiving care and two detainees out of a sample of cases that were investigated, waited 12 and 14 days before receiving treatment for fever, the report found. The wide-ranging evaluation also included a review of the facility's medical unit, which investigators found to be ""critically understaffed."" Vacant positions in the mental health department were left unfilled for more than a year in some cases while the nursing department had 11 vacancies. In total, 21 of the 72 positions in the medical unit were unfilled at the time of the review, according to the report. ""The vacancies hinder the medical department's ability to provide care to the detained population,"" the report's authors wrote. In response to the staffing concerns raised by the watchdog report, facility managers pointed to the reduced population of the facility as the reason behind the vacancies. The average daily population of the facility at the time of the review was 1,542 while its maximum capacity is 2,340, which is why management said medical positions did not need to be fully staffed."

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-administration-calls-grassroots-leaders-covid-vaccine-education/story?id=76810088,politics,"The Biden administration has announced a new effort to   and dispel misinformation that will employ leaders from churches, unions and nonprofits. Vice President Kamala Harris, who held an inaugural meeting Thursday morning with the community leaders tapped for the new program, will supply up-to-date public   resources and open up a line of communication between 275 grassroots groups on the ground and the federal government. The administration is calling it the COVID-19 Community Corps. ""No matter the community, trusted leaders are the best way to boost confidence. And trusted leaders -- you -- are the best way to deliver information,"" Harris told the members of the COVID-19 Community Corps at a video conference on Thursday. The group of leaders represent communities where vaccine hesitancy or access to   remains a challenge. As Harris acknowledged Thursday, the U.S. has not rolled out its vaccine program equitably and has struggled to reach areas in rural America and among minority communities, where distrust in medicine and the government is part of the problem, but access to vaccines nearby and clunky registration systems have compounded the issue. ""In some communities -- some of our hardest-hit communities -- it's too hard to access the vaccine or get information about it. And we have to be honest about that. We certainly are,"" Harris said. ""We have to be honest that in some communities, there is a concern about getting vaccinated, some based on mistrust based on history, some based on -- just rooted in misinformation, of which there is a lot out there. And we need your help to combat that,"" Harris said. Hyepin Im, a member of the Corps and the founder and CEO of Faith and Community Empowerment, told the group she planned to connect her organization's 400,000 churches to the government's resources. She also spoke about the importance of getting the vaccine to Asian Americans, many of whom are doctors and nurses who everyday fight the virus -- and discrimination because of the virus. ""I just want to lift this up, use us, leverage us. We have the space, we have the volunteers, we have the heart and we have the trust,"" Im said at the conference. Dr. Reed Tuxon, a co-founder of the Black Coalition Against COVID, a group formed by doctors and nurses to fight the racial disparities in health care that the pandemic has exacerbated, said he had already seen the power of the group's work and was eager to push forward with support from the federal government. ""We can tell that the polling over the last several months has flipped from 70% negative in the Black community wanting to take the vaccine to now down to 28%. And we know that the people in the middle are definitely reachable,"" Tuxon said. ""We see April as the critical month in this flat out race to the finish line."" U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, also appearing remotely, told the group they would help save lives. ""Hearing the facts from trusted sources is what will help people make good decisions about their health,” Murthy said. “And that's why I firmly believe that your involvement will save lives.” The Department of Health and Human Services, which is running the education campaign, also will supply funding for the new outreach program. Last week, HHS announced nearly $10 billion will go toward increasing vaccine access in hard-hit vulnerable communities, including $3 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding to support outreach. The program's leaders will be aided by a social media campaign and bilingual ads, which HHS will air on TV throughout April."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/teen-cheerleaders-snapchat-brings-supreme-court-clash-schools/story?id=76396105,politics,"MAHANOY CITY, Pa.  -- When 14-year-old Brandi Levy didn't make the varsity cut as a freshman cheerleader for the Mahanoy Golden Bears, she sounded off on social media, as teenagers are known to do. ""I was frustrated. I was upset. I was angry. And I  ,"" Levy told  . ""I said, 'F school, F cheer, F softball, F everything.'"" When she posted the vulgar message to her friends on a weekend in 2017, she never thought she'd hear about it again. But days later, the school accused her of breaching a code of conduct and   for an entire year. Levy's   post and the punishment that followed are now at the center of a major U.S. Supreme Court case that tests the boundaries of school discipline and the rights of students to free speech. ""This is the first time that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to decide whether the rules that apply to kids when they're in school also apply to their speech when they are outside of school,"" said Sara Rose, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney defending Levy in the case. The court in a famous   said that students   their First Amendment rights at the schoolhouse gate, but that educators can limit speech on school property when it's materially disruptive. It has not addressed how school-related speech expressed off-campus can be handled. ""This case is so important because it has implications, not just for school leaders in Pennsylvania, but across the nation to be able to provide for the safety and welfare of students in their schools,"" said Paul Healy, executive director of the Pennsylvania Principals Association, which is backing the Mahanoy Area School District in the case. Two lower federal courts sided with Levy in the dispute, ordering her returned to the team in 2017 and allowed her to continue her cheerleading career.  Later, in a sweeping decision, a federal appeals court affirmed the decision, saying a school's authority to enforce the rules ""does not apply off-campus."" ""If they would have just taken her aside and said, 'Watch; be careful.' But the action they took, I think reached above and beyond where they should be,"" said Larry Levy, Brandi's father, who sued the school with help from ACLU. ""When they're not under their school supervision, kids are under their parents supervision and the parents are the ones who should be able to decide what's appropriate for their children to say when they're at home,"" Rose said. The Mahanoy School District, which declined ABC News' request for an interview, says in court documents that the appellate decision threatens to handcuff coaches, principals and teachers nationwide. ""The First Amendment is not a territorial straitjacket that forces schools to ignore speech, that disrupts the school environment,"" the school district writes in its brief to the Supreme Court. ""Coaches and school administrators, not federal courts, should decide whether the coach can bench someone or ask a player to apologize to teammates,"" it said. ""The First Amendment is not a tool for micromanaging school determinations."" Healy said schools must be able to discipline students for inappropriate conduct online if they would clearly be disciplined for the same conduct offline. ""If you're going to be involved in an extracurricular activity and you sign that code of conduct, you're held to a higher standard,"" he said. ""You're supposed to be an ambassador of the school."" Levy maintains her Snapchat did not violate a school cheerleading code that required ""respect"" and ""no negative information"" to be expressed while part of the team. ""I think that it didn't because I was not directing towards any coaches. I didn't have the school's name in it. I didn't have the coaches' name or any teammates' names in it,"" she said. School officials disagree. ""That type of language and that type of rhetoric causes the school harm and can cause a disruption in the school,"" Healy said. ""Social media takes it to another step, right? There's a wider audience."" State and national associations of school superintendents, school boards, teachers and principals have all filed legal briefs supporting Mahanoy Area School District in the case, warning that a decision restricting off-campus discipline would hurt efforts to ensure safety and order and to combat  . Roughly one in three American middle or high school students say they've been victims of online harassment, according to the  . The group has found that the threat of punishment by schools is a key deterrent to would-be bullies. ""If they perceived that they would get in trouble at school for cyberbullying, they were significantly less likely to do it,"" said Justin Patchin, co-director of the center and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. ""If the courts come down and say, look, if it happens away from school, there's nothing you can do about it, I think that's going to potentially open up a lot of concern."" Maurine Molak of San Antonio, Texas, knows that concern first hand. Seven years ago, her 16-year-old son David was relentlessly targeted online by bullies as a high school sophomore and later took his own life. ""We went to the school for help, and because a lot of it had occurred off-campus, the jurisdiction of the school was in question,"" Molak told ABC News Live. ""And we tried to do everything that we possibly could. We moved schools. We talked to law enforcement, and our son David became feeling helpless and hopeless and he died by suicide."" Molak, who runs the  , said schools nationwide need more authority to intervene in cases of cyberbullying and that the campus boundary shouldn't be used as a shield. ""You would have a perpetrator's parents who would go to the school and say, you don't have jurisdiction over this and you can't punish my child because this did not happen on your ground, on your campus, in your school walls and that was just not right,"" she said. Molak said the Supreme Court case this month could  to save lives. ""I don't want to see that happen,"" she said. Free speech advocates said that while they don't condone bullying, Levy's case and others like it highlight how school discipline can go too far. ""In this country, we protect speech, even if it's offensive, even if it's disruptive, because we believe in the marketplace of ideas. And I think that's the lesson we need to teach kids,"" said the ACLU's Rose. ""Not that the government has broad authority to punish you for anything you say, no matter where you are."" Kimberly Diei, a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, told ABC News she empathizes with Brandi Levy over school punishment for off-campus postings on social media after her school tried to expel her over images it found objectionable. ""I do agree that there should be standards that are set, and I don't believe that anyone should be able to break the law off campus and then face no consequences from the institution,"" said Diei, ""But like I said, nothing I've done has caused any harm. The university, which declined comment to ABC News, later reversed the decision to expel. ""I can understand that there would be differences between adults in a doctorate program or other professional program versus high school students. But everyone has a personal life. Some people choose to be more open with theirs,"" Diei said. For Brandi Levy, the public spotlight was never something she wanted, but now said the Supreme Court could use her case to affirm the rights of teenagers everywhere. ""I just want the Supreme Court to realize that every person and every student and young adults have their freedom of speech and that the schools can't punish students for what they say outside of school and not in school grounds or school hours,"" she said. As for her own controversial Snapchat, Levy feels a tinge of regret, but offered no apologies. ""Now that I think about it, I feel like I shouldn't have done it, but it just -- it is what it is. I was 14, I was young. I wasn't thinking,"" she said. The court will hear arguments in the case on April 28 and hand down a decision by the end of June."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/partisanship-emerges-bidens-best-hope-phase-agenda-note/story?id=76815137,politics,"It's an odd goal to aspire to, particularly after your campaign was built on unity and the promise of working together. But the initial rollout of President Joe Biden's broadly structured and quite   has made clear how much   from here relies on partisanship -- no, not its opposite. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to dispel any doubt about the possibility of Republican support for the president, calling Biden's a ""bold, left-wing administration"" on Thursday. ""I'm going to fight them every step of the way,"" said McConnell, R-Ky. Lining up to oppose Biden continues to be a source of unity for the GOP. The White House and congressional Democrats know that, and while Biden can't and won't say he's not interested in pursuing Republican support, mechanisms are falling into place that will likely make it unnecessary. That, though, doesn't make passing infrastructure or   or   or   easy. Getting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to agree with Sen. Joe Manchin may be easier than securing McConnell's support, though not by much. The refrain from the White House remains that Biden's big-ticket items are bipartisan because  for them. That notion will be tested as Democrats debate tax hikes and vast expansions of social programs basically among themselves. Still, if Congress is going to pass those bills into law, it will be   behind a still-popular president and his initiatives -- not because Republicans are helping Biden out. As Biden pushes his infrastructure plan, members of his administration are emphasizing aspects of it that address environmental racism. ""The impacts and pollution and the climate crisis disproportionately threaten the lives and livelihoods of Americans of color,"" said Catherine Lhamon, deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council for Racial Justice and Equity. ""It is time for long overdue investments to tackle systemic racism and rebuild our economy and our social safety net so that every person in America can realize their full potential."" According to a  , African Americans are 75% more likely than white Americans to live in communities adjacent to businesses that produce hazardous waste.    found that Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately exposed to polluted air. Biden's plan aims to eliminate all lead pipes across the country, provide targeted investments in communities hard hit by natural disasters -- like flooding -- and mitigate impacts of pollution in communities of color where people are more likely to die of asthma than their white counterparts. Some progressives argue the plan   and Republicans have balked at the $2.5 trillion plan. Despite mixed feelings from lawmakers on the plan, the provisions of Biden's plan that aim to root out environmental inequity undoubtedly follow through on Biden's pledge to address racial disparities in all aspects of government. Following Georgia enacting a   that critics have called ""Jim Crow 2.0,"" the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice released   of state-level proposed legislation that contains provisions restricting voting access. As of March 24, 361  had been introduced in all but three state legislatures, according to its analysis; the states with the most restrictive bills are Texas, Georgia and Arizona. Georgia's 2021   Wednesday, so there won't be any more legislative action from the Peach State soon -- though   is already underway as three lawsuits have been filed seeking to block enforcement of the new law. But in Texas and Arizona, bills are advancing. While most Americans were asleep Thursday morning, Republicans in the Texas senate advanced a bill that would ban drive-thru voting and limit early voting hours to between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Majority-minority Harris County, a Democratic stronghold, offered drive-thru voting and 24-hour early voting in November. Debate started Thursday in the Arizona state house on a bill that would eliminate the ""permanent"" part of the state's early voting list by requiring election officials to remove any voters who don't respond to a notice after not voting early in at least one primary or general election over two cycles. After about 20 minutes of debate, the bill was   and not voted on. It passed the senate already, but every Republican in the house must vote for the bill or it will fail.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/memoir-hunter-biden-seeks-reframe-political-scandals-omits/story?id=76813811,politics,"After a year of withering attacks from President   and his allies during the 2020 campaign, Hunter Biden has emerged with a new memoir that seeks to reframe some of the scandals that nearly derailed his father's presidential bid -- but he almost entirely ignores others, leaving questions about the nation's First Family unresolved. In ""Beautiful Things,"" out next week, Hunter Biden charts a life defined by tragedy, addiction and scandal -- all in the shadow of a doting and concerned father,  , whose ascent to the White House came during some of his son's darkest moments. The account marks Hunter Biden's most extensive commentary to date on topics that emerged as fodder for his father's political foes during the presidential campaign, including his struggles with substance addiction and his efforts to make a profitable career while navigating the challenges and benefits of sharing his name with a powerful father. His dealings in   and his seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm during his father's tenure as vice president became an   and his allies, with Trump's drive to find dirt on Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine leading directly to his first impeachment trial. While Biden opens up on some of those topics, the book makes no mention of an ongoing federal investigation into his taxes, contains no new details about his controversial investments in China, and makes no meaningful nod to the mystery surrounding his infamous laptop -- the contents of which were dumped online and weaponized by Trump and his supporters in the waning weeks of the presidential campaign. ""Where's Hunter? I'm right here. I've faced and survived worse,"" he writes. ""I've known the extremes of success and ruin … I come from a family forged by tragedies and bound by a remarkable unbreakable love. I'm not going anywhere."" For what it lacks in clarity on some subjects, Biden's memoir makes up for with lurid and deeply troubling detail on others, most notably his repeated relapses into drug and alcohol abuse. The connective tissue for the story he tells is his older brother, Beau Biden, whose battle with brain cancer, Hunter writes, served as the impetus for his decision to take work with the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma in 2014. ""I want to be clear: Beau's health problems didn't prompt me to do something I wouldn't have done otherwise. The money was helpful, but I could've figured out another way to make it,"" Hunter Biden explained. ""I wasn't desperate. Yet it did provide me the ability not to work as hard at continuing to develop clients … that gave me more time to tend to Beau."" ""I'm not saying I would not have taken Burisma's offer if Beau hadn't gotten sick -- the money helped,"" he continued. In many ways, the book picks up where Biden left off following a handful of   he gave during the presidential campaign to try and diffuse the burgeoning scandals. As he did in his   with ABC News, Hunter Biden displays defiance about his work in Ukraine and China, discarding allegations of wrongdoing as a ""political fable"" and ""conspiratorial delusion"" intended to discredit his father's political ambitions. He insists that his only mistake was in failing to anticipate the onslaught of attention his role with Burisma would attract from Trump, his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and ""their circle of bandits."" In defending his overseas work, Biden points the finger back at the Trump family, who faced allegations of using the White House as a platform to bolster their business brand. ""I became a proxy for Donald Trump's fear that he won't be reelected,"" Biden wrote. ""He pushed debunked conspiracy theories about work I did in Ukraine and China, even as his own children had pocketed millions in China and Russia and his former campaign manager sat in a jail cell for laundering millions more from Ukraine"" -- an apparent reference to former Trump campaign chairman  , who in 2018 was found guilty of tax and bank fraud related to business transactions conducted prior to his work on Trump's 2016 campaign, and was later  . But Trump's political allies weren't the only ones scrutinizing Hunter Biden's business dealings during the campaign. Government ethics watchdogs also took issue with the son of a high-profile politician creating the appearance of a conflict of interest by taking on overlapping work. Both Hunter Biden and his father -- who, as vice president, played a key role in conducting U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine and China at the time -- have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. ""There's no question that my last name has opened doors, but my qualifications and accomplishments speak for themselves,"" Hunter Biden wrote. ""That those accomplishments sometimes crossed my father's spheres of influence during his two terms as vice-president -- how could they not?"" Throughout the book, Joe Biden is cast in a recurring role as Hunter Biden's lifeline, guiding him through moments of seemingly insurmountable difficulty in his relationships and his  . During one of many alcohol-fueled benders depicted in the book, Hunter Biden describes the then-vice president arriving at his Washington, D.C., apartment to check in on him. ""The last thing I wanted was Dad showing up in front of my apartment building with his massive security detail.  But almost a month in, he'd had enough.  He reduced his security to a minimum and knocked on my door.  I let him in,"" Hunter wrote. ""He looked aghast at what he saw. He asked if I was okay and I told him, sure, I was fine. 'I know you're not fine, Hunter,' he said, studying me, scanning the apartment. 'You need help.'  I looked into my dad's eyes and saw an expression of despair, an expression of fear."" The intimate details Hunter Biden shares in the book offer a glimpse into the personal and political challenges he created behind the scenes for his father as the longtime senator sought the White House.  But for the Biden family's critics, ""Beautiful Things"" will do little to explain some of the more troubling allegations Hunter faced during and after the campaign. In many cases, Hunter spares no detail in recounting difficult moments from his past, but glides over others -- including his discharge from the U.S. Navy Reserves in 2014 after cocaine appeared in a failed drug test. The most notable omission, perhaps, is any mention of the   into Hunter Biden's taxes, which he revealed in December after his father's electoral victory was sealed. ABC News has also reported that federal investigators in Delaware are looking into Hunter's business dealings in China -- another topic light on new details in the memoir. Hunter Biden's account of his work in China matches previous comments he's made on the matter, including in his   with ABC News. He describes taking a 2013 trip to Beijing with his father and daughter, Finnegan, on Air Force Two, introducing his father to a Chinese business associate, and helping launch a fledgling investment firm. ""And that was that,"" Hunter wrote, ""until Trump declared I walked out of China with $1.5 billion"" -- a figure Hunter has repeatedly disputed, claiming that the fund once aspired to raise that amount, but at the time had only scraped together $4.2 million. Hunter claims he bought a 10% stake in the firm after his father left the vice presidency. Another strange interlude from the election is also missing from ""Beautiful Things"": neither a denial that the incident occurred nor an explanation of the laptop Hunter Biden allegedly discarded at a Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair shop that later made its way into the hands of Giuliani. The contents of the laptop -- which included emails, text messages, and photos purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden -- were first reported by the New York Post. ABC News was not able to verify the contents of the laptop. The memoir also omits any mention of a former business partner who accused the Bidens of misleading the public about their overseas business dealings. Tony Bobulinski, in a remarkable moment of political theater, held a hastily organized press conference moments before the second presidential debate in October to accuse Joe Biden of lying about his knowledge of Hunter's foreign business dealings. Bobulinski’s accusations were based on unverified emails from May 2017 -- after Joe Biden had left the White House. At the time of his accusations, Bobulinski was being advised by a former counsel from the Trump administration who was later on the payroll of the Trump Organization,  . Bobulinski told reporters his allegations were ""corroborated by emails, WhatsApp chats, agreements, documents, and other evidence,"" including three cellphones he said he would be handing over to Senate Republicans later that week. Copies of the documents Bobulinski gave to Congress were obtained by ABC News, which was unable to verify their authenticity. But they did not do what Biden's critics alleged: provide conclusive evidence that Joe Biden was aware of, or benefited from, any deal. On the night of the Bobulinski press conference, Trump incorporated the fresh allegations against Biden into his attacks on the debate stage. Biden denied the charges and fired back with an impassioned defense of his son, which Hunter recounted in an epilogue written as a posthumous letter to his brother, Beau. ""Dad countered artfully, empathetically, indelibly,"" Hunter wrote. ""'My son,' he said, ignoring Trump while looking straight into a camera, 'like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem. He's overtaken it, he's fixed it, he's worked on it. And I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.'"" ""Those words not only disarmed Trump but gave comfort and hope to millions of Americans,"" Hunter continued. ""I felt nothing but pride. You would've too."" The memoir is filled with anecdotes about Hunter Biden's cycle of addiction, recovery and relapse that consumed his life for years, including a time in 2018 when he ""holed up"" at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles and spent six weeks smoking crack -- and learning to cook crack -- with his drug dealer and his prostitute girlfriend. ""I never slept. There was no clock. Day bled into night and night into day,"" he wrote. ""I came to dread sleep.  If I rested too long between hits on a pipe, I'd be thrown into a panic."" Hunter Biden ultimately explains how he managed to crawl out from the ""black hole of alcoholism and drug abuse,"" in no small part due to the support of his wife, Melissa, whom he married after only a brief courtship, in 2019. The two now have a baby, Beau, who is featured multiple times in the book -- as are his three older daughters. But other family matters are handled clumsily -- notably his fifth child, Navy, who is largely missing from the book. Navy was the subject of a paternity case in Arkansas after Hunter refused to pay child support to the baby's mother; he settled the suit for an undisclosed sum in March 2020 after a paternity test found with ""certainty"" that he was the father. ""Beautiful Things,"" scheduled for release on April 6, is being published by Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-infrastructure-plan-tests-democratic-unity-congress/story?id=76810133,politics,"President   unveiled his sweeping infrastructure proposal to expected opposition from Republicans. But before he can worry about finding sympathetic GOP lawmakers, he'll have to contend with members of his own party who are skeptical of the $2 trillion proposal. The plan introduced in Pittsburgh Wednesday is expected to be the first of two large packages   the nation's infrastructure and creating jobs. ""It's big, yes,"" Biden said at a press event on Tuesday. ""It's bold, yes. And we can get it done."" But the path forward on Capitol Hill for such a massive spending bill is precarious. If Democrats want to move swiftly, they'll likely need to do so using reconciliation, a procedural budget tool that allows passage of legislation without the necessary 60 votes to overcome a Senate filibuster. But Biden needs to hang onto moderate Democrats because a single Democratic defection in the evenly split Senate could sink the bill's chances. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., pushed to include more moderate proposals in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill and may seek similar concessions on infrastructure. ""Infrastructure, my God, when you think about it, that pothole doesn't have an R or D name on it, it'll blow your tire and ruin your car, it doesn't care,"" Manchin said during a panel last week. ""So, don't you think infrastructure is something that could bring us together?"" Manchin also cautioned his colleagues against adding unrelated items to the bill because he said he believes an infrastructure package could get a large, bipartisan backing ""unless you throw everything on top of it, all of your pent-up social frustration."" And therein lies the challenge in the House, where Biden can only afford to lose three Democrats given the tight margins and some progressive members are calling on the administration to go bigger and bolder. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,   Tuesday that Biden's plan falls short of expectations. ""This is not nearly enough. The important context here is that it's $2.25T spread out over 10 years,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted after details of the plan were released. ""For context, the COVID package was $1.9T for this year *alone,* with some provisions lasting 2 years. Needs to be way bigger."" The Congressional Progressive Caucus called the plan a ""welcome first step,"" but one that ""can and should be substantially larger in size and scope."" ""We have a limited window to get this done -- we must seize our chance to build back better with economy-wide investments that work for working families and communities of color,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the caucus, said in a statement Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back on that notion. ""I don't think they have a mandate to do what they're doing,"" he said at a press event in Kentucky on Thursday. ""If you look at the results in Congress, the 50-50 Senate and maybe a three-vote majority in the House, I don't think the American people gave them a mandate to drive our country all the way to the political left."" While Biden has been clear that he'll seek bipartisan support, during a conversation with Politico on Thursday, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said it is not necessarily a requirement. ""In the end, let me be clear: The president was elected to do a job. And part of that job is to get this country ready to win the future. That's what he's going to do,"" Klain said. ""We know what has bipartisan support in the country. And so we're gonna try our best to get bipartisan support here in Washington."" Klain said the president's proposal is meant as a starting point for further conversation. Several rank-and-file Senate Democrats are largely in favor of the Biden proposal and multiple members touted the bill's historic nature and praised it for being a job creator in statements released Wednesday. But even those championing the bill are also hoping to see changes to it. Biden has proposed funding the massive plan by implementing tax reforms. The most notable would raise taxes on large corporations to pay for the bill, walking back some of the corporate tax cuts pushed through by the Trump administration. Biden has promised that no one earning under $400,000 would see a tax raise to pay for the infrastructure proposal. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats are hoping that the infrastructure bill might be a vehicle to overturn another Trump-era tax rule. Schumer, who is largely supportive of the overall Biden proposal, said he plans to ""fight hard"" to get caps on state and local tax deductions, also known as SALT deductions, lifted as part of the bill. Under President Donald Trump's tax reform in 2017, a $10,000 limit was imposed on the amount of state and local tax that could be deducted from federal tax dues. The cap most severely impacts residents of states with higher state income taxes, such as the traditionally liberal states like New York and California. House Democrats are also rallying for changes to the SALT rules. ""I am not going to support any change in the tax code unless there is a restoration of the SALT deduction,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. It's unclear if any Democrats will actually vote against the package on the floor, but if the administration is looking to shore up its chances and avoid being derailed by Democratic defectors, it may be hard pressed to find sympathetic Republicans. Infrastructure has traditionally been a space for bipartisan cooperation, but Republicans said this package is too broadly focused. Biden personally called McConnell on Tuesday to brief him on the sweeping package, but the Republican described the infrastructure bill as a Trojan horse that is hiding ""more borrowed money and massive tax increases on all the productive parts of our economy."" ""I think that package that they are putting together now -- as much as we would like to address infrastructure -- is not going to get support from our side,"" McConnell said Thursday. ""The last thing the economy needs right now is a big whopping tax increase."" He also slammed the administration for trying to go it alone. Democrats rammed through the   spending bill on strict party lines, without a single Republican backer. While many moderate Republicans have yet to weigh in, it's possible this infrastructure package will also have to ride entirely on the backs of Democrats. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, said the Biden proposal was a far cry from a serious infrastructure proposal. ""President Biden's so-called 'jobs' proposal is a clear attempt to transform the economy by advancing progressive priorities in an unprecedented way,"" Moore Capito said in a statement. Still, Biden said Wednesday that he was hopeful Republicans would ultimately support the proposal and that he was open to ideas about ""how to pay for this plan."" He said he would invite Republicans to the Oval Office and listen to them. ""These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan,"" he said. ""If others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I'm open to other ideas, so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000."""

""The Office of Congressman Matt Gaetz and Luke Ball have agreed that it would be best to part ways.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cdc-fully-vaccinated-americans-resume-low-risk-travel/story?id=76834280,politics,"Fully vaccinated individuals can safely travel inside the U.S. and internationally, the CDC said in  , though they should still wear a mask when traveling on public transportation, including airplanes. The CDC says recent research on the effectiveness of the COVID-19   indicates there is low risk to vaccinated individuals and that they can travel without a COVID-19 test or quarantining after traveling. Still, the CDC is not ""recommending"" travel at this time due to the  , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. ""We know that right now we have a surging number of cases. I would advocate against general travel overall. Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel. Our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so. If you're -- if you are vaccinated it is lower at risk,"" she said in a briefing Friday. The CDC is only recommending testing for travelers who are returning to the U.S. from international travel -- keeping in place an order it announced in mid-January that requires all US-bound passengers to present a negative COVID-19 test before boarding. For fully vaccinated Americans, this updated CDC guidance relieves much of the stress that comes with incorporating COVID-19 restrictions into travel plans. The CDC does note, however, that Americans still need to follow the guidelines set by other countries for international travel, including testing or quarantining. The new guidance comes as nearly a third of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC defines a person as ""fully-vaccinated"" two weeks after they’ve received their last dose. In the case of J&J, a one-shot vaccine, that means two weeks after the first and only shot. For Pfizer and Moderna, it's two weeks after the second shot. The CDC is still recommending unvaccinated people avoid all nonessential travel. ""We haven't changed our guidance for nonessential travel at all. We are not recommending travel at this time, especially for unvaccinated individuals,"" Walensky said. ""Our guidance on an unvaccinated individual really is to limit travel to only essential travel with masking, protective -- prevention strategies. And so our update on this is really only for those who are vaccinated, and that represents about 20% of the adult population."" White House COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also asked Americans not to travel unless necessary. ""It is safe to travel without quarantining if fully vaccinated. Still, with cases rising & variants spreading, non-essential travel is not recommended yet,"" he tweeted just as CDC released the new guidance. The CDC has said it will continue to update guidance about how to socialize, travel and return to workplaces as more Americans get vaccinated. Fully vaccinated individuals can safely socialize indoors without masks or social distancing with other vaccinated individuals but should still avoid groups with unvaccinated people from multiple households,  . When that guidance was released in early March, Walensky said the agency would   until a higher percentage of Americans were vaccinated and the agency had more evidence regarding whether vaccinated individuals could spread the virus. Despite previous warnings against travel from the CDC, the   has continued to see a considerable uptick in passengers as the vaccine rollout grows. More than a million people have passed through TSA checkpoints every day since March 11. Walensky acknowledged that it is confusing to hear messages both about what vaccinated can do and the CDC asking people not to do them because of the concerning increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated people. ""The science shows us that getting fully vaccinated allows you to do more things safely, and it is important for us to provide that guidance, even in the context of rising cases. At the same time, we must balance this guidance with the fact that most Americans are not yet fully vaccinated, which is likely contributing to our rise in cases,"" she said. ""And that means we have to continue to reinforce messages about the critical importance of COVID-19 prevention measures."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-questions-ncaa-limits-student-athlete-compensation/story?id=76791975,politics,"With   in full swing, the   on Wednesday faced off against a group of   at the U.S. Supreme Court in a long-running dispute over limits on education-related  . The NCAA and its biggest, most lucrative   want the justices to overturn a ruling abolishing the limits, saying it would erode the amateur nature of college sports and open the door to ""pay for play.""  argue the rules unfairly suppress their ability to be rewarded for valuable skills and abilities in violation of federal antitrust law. The case is one of the biggest tests in decades for the NCAA and its limits on athlete compensation, and it could dramatically alter the nature of college sports, some experts said. While the NCAA allows schools to provide full tuition, room and board for athletes, it places limits on education-related benefits such as computers, paid internships and summer abroad programs which can value tens of thousands of dollars. ""In the present world, as the district court recognized, we permit student athletes to receive the 'actual and necessary' educational expenses,"" NCAA attorney Seth Waxman told the justices during oral arguments in the case. ""And the (lower) court said 'no, you can't place any limit on that' ... that permits schools to allow pay for play."" Waxman argued that amateurism is a defining feature of college sports and that lifting caps on compensation would create ""a regime in which student athletes can be paid large sums of money on account of their athletic performance, which does not distinguish college from professional sports."" A majority of justices appeared concerned by the association's position. Chief Justice John Roberts noted the tens of thousands of dollars in insurance policies some schools pay for their athletes. ""Doesn't that undercut amateurism?"" he said. Justice Clarence Thomas noted the disparity between coaches' salaries and what players are allowed to receive. ""it strikes me as odd that the coaches' salaries have ballooned and they're in the amateur ranks as are the players,"" Thomas said. Justice Samuel Alito showed empathy for athletes, who he said ""lead a pretty hard life"" and face ""shockingly low graduation rates."" ""So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up and they're cast aside without even a college degree. So they say, how can this be defended in the name of amateurism?"" Alito said. Justice Elena Kagan accused the NCAA of ""very high-minded"" talk of amateurism when the schools have essentially ""gotten together into an organization that has undisputed market power and they use that power to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice   said plainly that ""anti-trust law should not be a cover for exploitation of student athletes."" But several justices also voiced support for the association's need to maintain a distinction in college sports. Roberts worried aloud that rolling back too many limits on student athlete compensation could be ""like a game of Jenga."" ""You pull out one log and then another, and everything's fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing comes crashing down."" ""I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run,"" added Justice Stephen Breyer. Thomas said he was ""perplexed"" about how to ensure ""an important distinction between student athletes and professional athletes without (the NCAA) constantly being involved in litigation."" The athletes' attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, repeatedly sought to assure the court that the nature of college sports would not be altered by ending the cap on education-related expenses covered by schools. ""We heard over and over again that each loss was going to destroy college sports … it's never happened,"" Kessler said. ""We're not challenging any restrictions or rules regarding that they have to be students. And, in fact, the education-related benefits here would help them to succeed as students."" The court is expected to hand down a decision in the case by the end of June."

In brief remarks at the top of the meeting, Biden announced that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo would take on the additional responsibility. In conjunction with his White House staff, Biden said the group of former mayors and governors will ""represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public ... and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward."" ""I want to thank them in advance for the role they're going to play with this added assignment I'm asking them to take on. And we'll be discussing that today, among other things,"" Biden said of the meeting, at which the new infrastructure proposal was expected to be a major topic of conversation. Biden also issued a directive to his Cabinet members as they work to advance his agenda, asking them to follow through on the ""Buy American"" executive action he took back in January ""to make sure that when the government is spending taxpayers’ money that they're spending it on American-made goods, American corporations and American employees."" ""Today, I'm directing every member of the Cabinet, I mean this sincerely, everyone, to take a hard look at their agency spending and make sure it follows my 'Buy American' standard,"" Biden told the group. ""I'm going to ask you all to report back to me at the next Cabinet meeting."" The 25-person meeting included the 15 confirmed head of departments, plus seven Cabinet-level department heads, including Shalanda Young, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. Biden’s initial choice for the role, Neera Tanden, withdrew her nomination due to opposition in the Senate. Vice President Kamala Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain, both members of the Cabinet, were also in attendance, along with nine senior members of the White House staff, including National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice and White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients. The meeting looked different than previous ones as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of taking place in the Cabinet Room, the traditional venue, the group gathered in the East Room to abide by public health guidelines and allow for social distancing. The gathering was timed to follow Biden’s launch of the first portion of his new infrastructure plan, a multi-trillion-dollar proposal aimed at traditional infrastructure projects to repair roads, rails and bridges, but which also includes billions to expand broadband internet access, community-based care for elderly Americans and investments in clean energy. ""It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh Wednesday. ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II."" The meeting was expected to focus on not only infrastructure and the role Cabinet members will play but also the continued implementation and communication on Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, according to a White House official. The press availability at the top of the meeting drew a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump’s lengthier press availability during his first Cabinet meeting in June 2017, during which members of his Cabinet offered effusive praise for the then-president, who offered his own praise for his administration’s accomplishments despite no major legislation having yet passed through Congress. No members of Biden's Cabinet spoke during the brief press availability, which lasted less than two minutes."

""We do not have the suspect on file with U.S. Capitol Police,"" Acting Metro Police Department Chief Robert Contee said. ""So there is no indication at this time that there is any nexus to any member of Congress."" Conte also said the incident didn't appear to be terror related. Congress was in recess when the incident occurred, and many staff offices were closed in observance of Good Friday. There were approximately 2,300 National Guardsmen already on mission at the Capitol following the  , when protesters breached the Capitol -- five people died, including  . The D.C. National Guard deployed an ""Immediate Reaction Force"" to support Capitol Police during Friday's incident, according to a spokesperson. About 40 National Guardsmen lined up with riot gear to block access to Constitution Avenue, just east of where the incident took place. Capitol Police and the National Guard also blocked off roads and pedestrian access near the Supreme Court. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered flags at the Capitol lowered to half-staff in honor of the officer who died, a spokesperson for Pelosi said in a tweet Friday. President Joe Biden also issued a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff through Tuesday at the White House and on federal grounds in Washington, D.C. In a statement, the president said he and the first lady were “heartbroken” over the deadly attack. “We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family, and everyone grieving his loss. We know what a difficult time this has been for the Capitol, everyone who works there, and those who protect it,” the statement said. Pittman also asked that the public ""keep U.S. Capitol police and their families in your prayers."" ""This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol police after the events of January 6 and now the events that have occurred here today. So I ask that you keep our U.S. Capitol police family in your thoughts and prayers,"" she said."

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-starts-selling-infrastructure-plan-american-people/story?id=76854017,politics,"Four days after President Joe Biden unveiled his massive, multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, the White House is taking steps to sell the policy to the American people as the administration works with Congress on drafting legislation. In his ""Weekly Conversation"" -- Biden’s version of a weekly address -- the president, along with White House press secretary Jen Psaki, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Deputy White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi, highlighted elements of the policy while answering questions from the public about the plan. The strategy of speaking directly to Americans may prove essential as the proposal faces opposition from both sides of the aisle in Congress, with some progressive Democrats saying the investments do not go far enough, while Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would fight the bill ""every step of the way."" When pressed on McConnell’s pledge to obstruct, Biden pointed to the important role he believes voters will play in passing the policy. ""If the Republicans say the next phase in my plan, we don’t need to invest in VA hospitals and keep the sacred obligation we made to so many Americans. If the Republicans say the 400,000 homes and schools and day care centers that have lead pipes, lead pipes, delivering water to their doors. If they say we shouldn’t be doing that...I think the Republican voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done,"" Biden warned. The White House is hoping to move forward on dual tracks -- working to bridge divides in Congress while also making inroads with constituents to build support for the policy and increase pressure on lawmakers. The president has already tasked five members of his Cabinet to take the lead on selling the proposal to the American people and Congress. The so-called 'Jobs Cabinet' includes a group of former mayors and governors: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. ""Working with my team here in the White House, these Cabinet members will represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public and selling the plan, and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward,"" Biden said at the top of his first in-person Cabinet meeting Thursday. The group's work has already gotten underway: In addition to a media blitz to bring their message to the American people, each member of the group was tasked with making calls to the Democratic chairs and Republican ranking members of committees overseeing their respective departments. The members are also slated to hold a series of committee-specific meetings when members are back in session after the Easter break, a White House official said. The policy, dubbed the ""American Jobs Plan"" by the White House, goes beyond traditional infrastructure projects, with Biden declaring it ""a once-in-a-generation investment in America."" The plan does allocate $621 billion toward modernizing roads, railways, ports, airports, mass transit and highways, as well as $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes nationwide. But it also includes $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans, a $180 billion investment in clean energy and $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country. ""The idea that we're not in a position where we invest in loans and grants to companies and local governments and nonprofits and rural co-ops to be able to come into the 21st century with a minimum requirement of having access to the internet seems to be a very short sighted,"" Biden said during his address Saturday. The White House also took the opportunity to highlight its climate efforts in the bill, which are likely to draw the ire of Republicans. ""This jobs plan upgrades housing. It electrifies transportation. It invests in innovation and it builds out the supply chains that we're going to need to tackle the climate crisis. And at the same time, it targets 40% of the benefits of the investment in the communities that have been disadvantaged,"" Zaidi said during Saturday's question and answer session, outlining the proposal's main climate investments. A White House official said the administration is looking to see ""significant progress"" by Memorial Day, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping to get the plan through the House by the Fourth of July, though that timing could slip to later in the month, according to a source familiar with her thinking. The timeline could create a tough road ahead for the White House as it works to bridge the divides in Congress and get the bill passed, though a White House official stressed they expect there will be more time for consultations and input on the plan than there was for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief measure passed in mid-March without any Republican support. In an interview Thursday, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the White House wanted to move forward in a bipartisan way ""if at all possible"" but didn’t rule out the idea that Democrats could push the plan through without Republican support, as was the case with Biden’s COVID-19 relief plan. ""In the end, let me be clear: The president was elected to do a job. And part of that job is to get this country ready to win the future. That's what he's going to do. We know it has bipartisan support in the country. And so we're gonna try our best to get bipartisan support here in Washington,"" Klain said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dell-american-airlines-att-weigh-restrictive-voting-bills/story?id=76809993,politics,"Amid a growing national discourse over ballot access, several major companies voiced concerns -- and in some cases, outright objections -- over bills that voting rights advocates say would make it harder to vote in Texas. Dell and American Airlines specifically called out Texas Senate Bill 7 and its version in the House, House Bill 6, while AT&T took a broader look at the complexity of elections, the responsibility of lawmakers, and a broader ""responsibility to engage."" ""Instead of seeking to limit access, governments should provide innovative pathways for citizens to have their voices heard. Legislation like HB6 does the opposite, and we are opposed to it,"" a statement from Dell, that added that voting rights had been especially ""hard-earned"" by ""women and communities of color,"" said. State Senate Republicans advanced SB7 in the early hours of Thursday morning. The legislation proposes changing existing voting rules, including shortening early voting hours and banning drive-through voting, which was popular among heavily populated, diverse areas when voters cast ballots in November. The Senate bill also prohibits election officials from sending out mail voting applications to voters if they did not individually request the forms, and requires disabled voters to provide specific proof of disability from the federal government or a physician. That same day, the Texas House Elections Committee heard testimonies about their chamber's version of the bill. While HB6 echoed the Senate bill's provisions regarding mail ballot solicitation, it also included new rules for how voters could be assisted with filling out their ballots and expanded the access poll-watchers could have within polling places. American Airlines directed its statement at the Senate bill, saying it included ""provisions that limit voting access."" ""To make American's stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it. As a Texas-based business, we must stand up for the rights of our team members and customers who call Texas home, and honor the sacrifices made by generations of Americans to protect and expand the right to vote,"" the statement said. Although none of the companies explicitly indicated an intent to explore economic ramifications against the state or its Republican lawmakers if the bills were made into law, their statements were a signal that some of the biggest corporate stakeholders -- and employers -- in Texas are keeping track of the bills. In a statement issued on the heels of American Airlines' comment, Texas Lieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick alleged the airline giant's government relations representative called his office minutes before and ""admitted that neither he nor the American Airlines CEO had actually read the legislation."" ""Texans are fed up with corporations that don't share our values trying to dictate public policy. The majority of Texans support maintaining the integrity of our elections, which is why I made it a priority this legislative session,"" Patrick said. The Republican-led focus on ""election integrity"" comes just months after voter turnout reached new heights across the Lone Star State in the lead-up to the pandemic-era 2020 election -- and after Texas Democrats laid out their roadmap for flipping the state blue in coming years. Texas-based voting rights advocates decried the efforts as being especially detrimental to voter groups that traditionally make up Democrats' base. ""These bills, if passed, are going to make it harder [to vote] and aim specifically to suppress minority voter turnout. They would undermine the ability of local election officials to encourage voter participation and they create new barriers for voters themselves,"" U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, said of the bills on a press call with reporters. Meanwhile, some disability advocates say the parameters set by SB7 would make disabled voters face an equivalent of a poll tax, given that not every disabled person who is eligible to vote is also able to present an official, documented diagnosis like the legislation demands. With high political stakes on the line, Charlie Bonner, a spokesperson for the grassroots group MOVE Texas, suggested the legislative push could ultimately backfire on Republicans. ""I think what we've seen time and time again, is Texans hate a cheater. They see what's happening now -- that Gov. (Greg) Abbott and his cronies in the House and Senate can't win on the issue, so they're trying to change the rules. People see that and they understand what's happening,"" Bonner told reporters during a recent call."

The  , Noah Green, was killed by police after he exited his vehicle and moved towards officer with a knife, authorities said. Investigators continue to examine details Green’s life and what may have led him to a violent end, combing through social media postings and examining his movements during his final weeks. One question: Were there any indications of mental illness or triggering events he experienced? In social media posts, Green indicated on his Facebook page on March 17 that ""these past few years have been tough and these past few months have been tougher."" The 25-year-old also says he left his job due to ""afflictions."" Green’s Facebook page makes several references to the Nation of Islam. ""One thing I’m assured everyone can lean on, as I’ve leaned on, is faith in the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan as the man who can carry us through the dark hour,"" Green’s wrote in a March 17 post. In a separate March 17 Facebook post, Green writes, ""I encourage everyone to study Revelations, study the signs of end times, study who the beast is, study who the anti-Christ is, study who the false prophet is, and study the created images during those times."" It is unclear if Green’s religious beliefs were a factor in Friday’s incident or if his faith may have been a factor that kept him from unravelling sooner. Last December, while living in Indiana, Green filed a petition with the Marion County Circuit Court to change his name to Noah Zaeem Muhammad. The petition was dismissed for an apparent failure to appear for a hearing on March 30, just three days before the attack, according to court records. The Washington Post   Green’s family members had, in recent years, become concerned about his mental state and suicidal thoughts.  The possibility that the attack was staged to provoke a “suicide by cop” scenario is also being examined by investigators, sources say. Over the weekend, the Capitol Police union said that members were 'reeling' after Friday's attack. ""This attack, combined with the violent events of the January 6th insurrection, have left our officers reeling,” union chairman Gus Papathanasiou said.  “Evans was well respected within the department and his loss will not be forgotten. People should also know he was more than a police officer protecting the Capitol – he was a husband and a loving father to two children. Please keep the entire Evans family in your prayers as they go through this difficult time."" Papathanasiou said that over 500 officers are set to retire in the next 3-5 years, and many younger officers have approached him about leaving for other departments. ""I could not be prouder of them. They continue to work even as we rapidly approach a crisis in morale and force numbers,” he said. ""We are struggling to meet existing mission requirements even with the officers working massive amounts of forced overtime."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/corporate-squeezes-upend-politics-voting-rights-note/story?id=76867291,politics,"It's a debate that's fundamental to democracy, and it's playing out at the state and federal levels in much different directions. But it may not be possible at this moment to even have a true debate over voting rights. The politics of the issue has been upended in recent days -- and if there's a squeeze on  , the folks at   might know a thing or two about that. The belated condemnation of Georgia's   -- capped by MLB's decision   from Atlanta this summer -- shows how major businesses are calculating that neither silence nor nuance works on the most charged and polarizing issues of the day. Speaking of lack of nuance, former President Donald Trump is back in the conversation, calling for the very boycotts some progressives favored just a few days ago. Discussion of the right to vote is now mixed up with conservative cries of ""cancel culture"" and calls for scrutiny on corporate relationships with China. Trump is engaging while continuing to peddle falsehoods about the last  . But even some prominent supporters who have refused to go there are slamming President Joe Biden for exaggerating the potential impact of Georgia's law. ""He is lying to cause racial divisions in this country,""  , the former New Jersey governor and ABC News contributor, said of Biden on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday. States including Iowa, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey and Virginia have already settled on new voting laws, with outcomes that reflect the different states' political tint. But the debate is hot and could easily become overheated in states  , Arizona and Florida, as well as in Congress, where the House-passed voting bill awaits Senate action. Big businesses are off the sidelines. But the rules of the game may be changing. A coalition of more than a dozen advocacy groups focused on women and caregivers has launched a multimillion-dollar effort dubbed #CareCantWait, pressuring the Biden administration to include paid family and medical leave, subsidized child care and a $450 billion investment in creating a million union caregiving jobs in recovery legislation. Biden's , which includes a significant focus on job creation, devotes money to upgrading child care facilities and acknowledges that childcare could be a driver of employment for women. It doesn't provide solutions to address the high cost of childcare or acknowledge that caregiving amid pandemic-related shutdowns disproportionately  , though White House officials said child care will be part of the second component of the plan. During congressional testimony in February, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the lack of child care policy has put the U.S. behind many other nations in terms of female participation in the workforce. ""Our peers, our competitors, advanced economy democracies, have a more built-up function for child care, and they wind up having substantially higher labor force participation for women,"" said Powell. Biden has referred to this  as a   and advocates said they're going to push to ensure that the nation's women -- who are the backbone of America's so-called ""caregiving infrastructure"" because they take on the majority of caregiving responsibilities -- are included.

The loosening restrictions in the pandemic's   track with  . So far, nearly 20 million Californians have received at least one dose, and Gov. Gavin Newsom is now among them. Just last week Newsom   to people over 50, and has been traveling the state pushing for more vaccination sites to open as he prepares to expand vaccine eligibility to those 16 and above later this month. In an interview with ABC News, he said preventing a coronavirus rebound is one of his top priorities. Without continuing the proper precautions, Newsom warned: ""This thing could blow up quickly, particularly now with over seven variants."" Since mid-January, the state's seven-day average of cases has declined by over 94%, and the stakes for Newsom to keep those numbers dropping couldn't be higher. His handling of the pandemic is one of the reasons that led to the most recent   against him. Organizers report 2.2 million people have signed a petition to trigger a recall election. ""This is really an assault on California values, and I hope we can stay united,"" Newsom told ABC News.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/americans-us-buttigieg-bidens-infrastructure-plan/story?id=76855812,politics,"Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said Sunday that he believes it could be possible to get Republicans on board with President Joe Biden's massive, $2 trillion infrastructure bill that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said he plans to fight ""every step of the way."" ""I'm having a lot of conversations with Republicans in the House and Senate, who have been wanting to do something big on infrastructure for years. We may not agree about every piece of it, but this is one area where the American people absolutely want to see us get it done,""   George Stephanopoulos. ""In my view, this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. I don't think in the next 50 years, we're going to see another time when we have this combination of a demonstrated need, bipartisan interest, widespread impatience and a very supportive president who is committed,"" Buttigieg added. But while Buttigieg said he was hopeful that bipartisan work on the bill was possible, he hinted that passing the measure along party lines was not out of the question. ""One way or the other, we've got to get it done,"" he said. The president tasked Buttigieg and four other members of his Cabinet   on selling his   to the American people and Congress. Dubbed the ""American Jobs Plan"" by the White House, it goes beyond traditional infrastructure projects of repairing roads, railways, bridges and ports, with Biden declaring it a ""once-in-a-generation investment in America.""  $621 billion in updates to modernize roads, rails, ports, airports, mass transit and highways, as well as $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes. It also includes $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans, a $180 billion investment in clean energy and $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country, paid for in part by increasing the corporate tax rate lowered under former President Donald Trump to 21% up to 28%. The White House has previewed the proposal will be followed up by a second package in the coming weeks focused on ""human infrastructure,"" with additional funding for schools, health care and childcare. Buttigieg said he was confident the administration would ""find strong deal space"" with Republicans and even some moderate Democrats, like Sen. Joe Manchin, who are opposed to raising the corporate tax rate to 28% to pay for the infrastructure package through pressure from the American public. In an earlier interview with Stephanopoulos, Sen. Roy Blunt said he has reached out to the White House ""a couple of times,"" and told them they have ""an easy bipartisan win"" if they keep it narrowly focused on infrastructure. ""There's more in the package for charging stations for electric vehicles than roads, bridges and airports and ports,"" he said Sunday. ""It's a small part of what they're calling an infrastructure package that does much more than infrastructure."" Stephanopoulos raised that point with Buttigieg. ""It is true that only about 5% of this bill goes for traditional roads and bridges? You've got 20% caregiving for the elderly, about 13% for investments in like the Green New Deal -- so why not focus on that traditional core infrastructure?"" Stephanopoulos pressed Buttigieg. ""Let's be clear, there's a lot more than roads and bridges that are part of infrastructure,"" Buttigieg said in response. ""I've got a lot of respect for Sen. Blunt but I'm going to work to try to persuade him that electric vehicle charging infrastructure is absolutely a core part of how Americans are going to need to get around in the future and not the distant, far-off future, but right now,"" he added. The White House is working on dual tracks to sell the bill to members of Congress and their constituents, to push for compromise on both sides of the aisle. Part of the sales pitch is touting the package not only as an infrastructure measure, but also a plan that will create millions of jobs, in part through the administration's clean energy efforts, that have been met with skepticism from some labor groups. Buttigieg said he understood the reluctance of some union workers who say that the positions the administration is looking to transition them to are not comparable with the jobs they currently hold. ""I'm not saying we're gonna take a machinist and turn them into a computer programmer. What I'm saying is that we're gonna have jobs for insulators on these building retrofits and painters and carpenters -- all good union jobs,"" Buttigieg said, defending the plan. ""We're not talking about extremely mysterious job creation here. We're talking about jobs that already exist,"" he added. As the White House hopes to move ahead on Biden's second legislative undertaking with bipartisan support, they will also face the challenge of keeping factions of their own party on board with the measure to get it done. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor brushed off criticisms from Progressive Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said the bill did not make a hefty enough investment. He said the criticism was ""a natural part of this conversation."" When it comes to Democrats who said they will not support the measure until state and local tax deductions -- capped during the Trump administration -- are reinstated, Buttigieg said the administration is open to looking at ideas on how to make that happen, but also stressed Biden wants to see progress on the policy. ""The president is hoping for major progress from Congress before Memorial Day, and we can't allow this thing to just keep dragging on because the need is there today. Each passing day our infrastructure crumbles, that hurts our economy and it puts our safety in danger,"" he said. ""We're determined to make sure that infrastructure week is no longer a punch line around Washington. That's what this robust plan will do and it's time for action."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/capitol-fencing-removed-friday-attack-sen-roy-blunt/story?id=76855778,politics,"Congress needs to balance making the Capitol complex secure, while at the same time maintaining its openness to the public, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" days after a   rammed his vehicle into a U.S. Capitol barricade, killing a Capitol Police officer. ""I don't think it does the job. In fact, the fencing was right there when the car drove through,"" the senator told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""I think it would be a mistake for fencing to be a permanent part of the Capitol,"" Blunt added. The fatal incident on Friday occurred less than three months after the   of the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead. Blunt also cited retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led a   at the U.S. Capitol in January and told lawmakers that fencing can create a false sense of security. ""The idea that what happens next at the Capitol will be what happened last is almost certain not to be the case,"" Blunt said Sunday. In an earlier interview on ""This Week,"" Stephanopoulos asked Honoré about the timing for removing the fencing put up after the Jan. 6 riots. ""You say we're trying to balance security and accessibility. We know that many members of Congress have called for the permanent fencing to come down after the Jan. 6 siege. Did it start to come down too soon?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""I don't think so, George. The fencing and people we were seeing were a result of post-1/6, as well as preparation for the inauguration. It never came down because there was a lot of threat messages that came in for potential activity on 4 March,"" he said. The retired lieutenant general said the scaling back of the permanent fencing perimeter around the complex was in line with a reduction of threats aimed at the complex. And although Honoré agreed the Capitol is increasingly becoming a target, he said, ""From inside the Capitol, talking to many members of Congress on both the Senate and the House side, both parties, they all left us with the impression their number one mission is to secure the Capitol, but make sure it has 100% public access."" Blunt is leading a bipartisan effort to investigate the riots and he has co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and District of Columbia Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton to prevent the use of permanent fencing around the Capitol. Among the suggestions in the security review is a fence that could be quickly erected as needed. ""We've given them recommendations, the Corps of Engineers is standing by to reinforce the outer grounds of the Capitol with contractors coming in to put advanced fencing that can come out of the ground as required,"" Honoré said. He also stressed that the most important solution to improving security at the complex is to increase the number of Capitol Police officers and provide them with additional funding through a supplemental budget. ""It's time for Congress to work the plan. We gave them the plan. We worked hard to give it to them. Now they've got to work to make that plan come through,"" Honoré told Stephanopoulos. ""The police in the Capitol deserve this. Our nation deserves it. And those families who have lost loved ones deserve it.  And we need to up our game in support of the Capitol Police,"" Honoré continued. Blunt agreed with most of Honoré's assessment but pushed back on increasing the size of the Capitol Police force. ""What we're doing to recruit and what we're doing to train -- I think that's maybe even more important than the size of the forces, "" Blunt said. However, the Capitol Police Union is urging Congress to increase the security presence around the complex with the organization's chairman Gus Papathanasiou writing in press release Saturday that ""this attack, combined with the violent events of the January 6th insurrection, have left our officers reeling."" ""General Honoré's Task Force has called for the hiring of hundreds of additional officers and dozens of other operational, training, and physical infrastructure improvements. We support General Honoré recommendations,"" Papathanasiou added. ""There are immediate steps Congress can take to address this. The question is, will Congress do so?"" The debate over providing more money to the Capitol Police comes as Congress prepares to take up a $2 trillion initiative on infrastructure proposed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday. With Republicans already expressing opposition to the package, Stephanopoulos asked Blunt why the GOP would resist spending that is popular with the public. ""Your leader, Mitch McConnell, has already signaled Republicans are going to oppose those proposals. But polls show that investing more in roads, bridges, high-speed rail, broadband is widely popular. Any worry that the GOP is on the wrong side of this issue?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""Well, I'm actually for all of that. If the proposal was to do just that, I don't think there'd be a problem with the bipartisan group of supporters for this package,"" Blunt responded. ""I've reached out to the White House a couple of times now and said, you've got an easy bipartisan win here if you'll keep this package narrowly focused on infrastructure."" Blunt said one of the problems he has with the bill is that it provides a significant amount of funding to electric charging stations compared to roads, bridges and airports. In a later interview with Stephanopoulos, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg directly responded to Blunt. ""I've got a lot of respect for Sen. Blunt, but I'm going to work to try to persuade him that electrical vehicle charging infrastructure is absolutely a core part of how Americans are going to need to get around in the future, and not the distant, far-off future, but right now,""  Stephanopoulos also challenged Blunt on Republican opposition to how Biden plans to fund the bill. ""The Republicans are against the tax increase and corporate tax increase that President Biden is proposing, raising it back to 28%, which is still below where it was before President Trump's tax cuts. The stock market is booming now. Corporate stocks are up. So, isn't this a good time to invest some of those profits in the future?"" Stephanopoulos asked. Blunt said that the Democrats' proposal to raise the corporation tax could negatively impact businesses looking to bring jobs back to the U.S. ""As businesses are thinking about resourcing and bringing things back to the United States -- restructuring how their companies are put together -- the corporate tax is an important element of that,"" the senator said. Additionally, Blunt pointed out the unlikeliness that any Republican senator would vote for raising the corporation tax just four years after passing legislation that lowered it.

(END VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER:  From ABC News, it's ""This Week."" Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good morning, and welcome to this week on this Easter Sunday. A quiet Good Friday in Washington was shattered this week by the second attack on the Capitol in three months. A troubled follower of the Nation of Islam rammed his vehicle into north barricade, ran towards officers with a knife, before police shot him dead. And, this morning, flags at the Capitol and the White House are flying at half-staff to honor officer William ""Billy"" Evans, an 18-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police who lost his life defending that seat of our democracy. All this has prompted renewed questions about how to secure the Capitol, so we begin this morning with retired General Russel Honore, who led the task force appointed to review security in the wake of the January 6 siege. General Honore, thanks for joining us again on this Easter Sunday. We don't know exactly what motivated the killer on Friday, but it does seem increasingly clear that the Capitol is becoming more of a target than ever. LT. GEN. RUSSEL HONORE (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Absolutely, George. From inside the Capitol, talking to many members of Congress on both the Senate and the House side, both parties, they all left us with the impression their number one mission is to secure the Capitol, but make sure it has 100 percent public access. This is something that is valued by every member of Congress we spoke to in the six weeks we were there, and that they want public access. That comes at -- with a balance, with reengineering, with resources needed to the Capitol Police, with upgrading our cameras and sensors and the barriers around the Capitol. That's going to come at a cost. And we have given part of that bill to the Congress, and we need them to work -- move forward now and fund the supplemental that would get this started, George. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But can an attack like this really have been prevented? This seems like a troubled loner. HONORE:  Well, we have always worried about the lone wolf. Whether it's personally motivated or dominated by some ideology, at the end of the day 24/7, 365, the Capitol Police have to be ready to protect that Capitol. This is the only police force in America that works for Congress. There's no layer of a command between that police force and Congress. That is their police force. It's designed and built to protect that one building. And, yes, there are those who made snorty comments about, well, they have got all these police to protect one building. Yes, it is the most important building in America, because it's the seat of our democracy. If that building and the people in it don't function, we no longer have democracy. And whatever price we have to pay to protect it, we need to do it, George. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You say we're trying to balance security and accessibility. We know that many members of Congress have called for the permanent fencing to come down after the January 6 siege. Did it start to come down too soon? HONORE:  I don't think so, George. The fencing and people we were seeing were a result of post-1/6, as well as preparation for the inauguration. It never came down because there was a lot of threat messages that came in for potential activity on 4 March. So, the police left it up based on chatter. And once that time passed, the reduction in the National Guard was reduced to about a fourth of what it was, and now they're in transition. The architect of the capitol, along with the Capitol Police Board, we've given them recommendation, the Corps of Engineers is standing by to reinforce the outer grounds of the Capitol with contractors coming in to put advanced fencing that can come out of the ground as required, that can provide more sensors as well as an integration of the cameras. We've given them the plan.  We worked the plan hard.  Now it's time for Congress to work the plan.  We gave them the plan.  We worked hard to give it to them.  Now they've got to work to make that plan come through, and that's called a supplemental because the police in the Capitol deserve this.  Our nation deserves it.  And those families who have lost loved ones deserve it.  And we need to up our game in support of the Capitol Police, George. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You did lay out a series of recommendations, including more officers, updated screenings and background checks.  What's most important for Congress to implement right now? HONORE:  The additional resources.  They are going to have to recruit hard, and in order to recruit, they're going to need a special budget to get someone to come and help them run -- you know, we are competing against police officers for police forces all around the country, including the Capital Region.  And hiring police now is not easy, George.  Maybe one in 10 get through the screening process. The Capitol made some adjustments.  They increased their recruiting age to 40 that would allow them to take on veterans coming out of the military, as well as extending the age to 60.  All of these internal actions they were able to take.  But when you are 233 (ph) officers short today, you might have a problem and that has been exacerbated last year because they did not get a police class through because of COVID. So they've got catching up to do.  They're going to need help.  And the National Guard are going to have to continue to assist them.  After 9/11, we had 250 National Guard stayed at the Capitol for two years.  And we may look forward to seeing that happen again.  And thank God to the National Guard, all the great work they've done, and hats off to them, and those who are away from their families today at the Capitol, America appreciates the work they do. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly do.  General Honore, thanks for your time this morning. HONORE:  Happy Easter. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANOPOULOS:  And we are joined now by Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. Senator Blunt, thanks for joining us this morning.  You just heard General Honore right there.  He said it's time for Congress to pass this funding. SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, in terms of supplemental budget, I agree with that.  I think we need to be looking at what our needs are.  We need to be thinking about how we're gathering intelligence as it relates to the Capitol, and what we're doing to recruit, and what we're doing to train.  I think that's maybe even more important than the size of the force. As the former chairman of the Rules Committee, and now the top Republican on that committee, certainly working with Capitol Police to help solve these problems and working generally to look at how we secure the Capitol, but at the same time, make it as secure as it needs to be but as free as we could possibly make it. It's an important element of who we are.  It's an important symbol of who we are.  And we need to keep that in mind with every decision we make. STEPHANOPOULOS:  So no question, this permanent fencing still has to come down? BLUNT:  I think the permanent fencing should come down.  I don't think it does the job.  In fact, the fencing was right there when the car drove through.  The question, how far back would you ever establish fencing?  One of the things that General Honore talked about weeks ago was the fact that actually fencing can create a false sense of security on a daily basis. Some kind of temporary fencing that can be put up when you need it like we always secure the Capitol before the inaugurations, two of which I've chaired, is an important element to that event, but I think it would be a mistake for fencing to be a permanent part of the Capitol.  The message we send is the wrong message.  Frankly, we're probably preparing for the wrong thing.  The idea that what happens next at Capitol will be what happened last is almost certain not to be the case. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Are we indeed seeing intelligence?  I know you have a special focus on Capitol security.  Are we indeed seeing intelligence that the Capitol has become more of a target? BLUNT:  Well, I think the Capitol has always been a target.  It was a target I'm sure on 9/11.  It’s -- it’s been a target over decades, and we need to be aware of that. I do think really doing a better job of analyzing the intelligence we have, knowing what we should be prepared for. Frankly, the new sergeant-at-arms in the Senate has a military intelligence background. The new sergeant-at-arms in the House was in charge of the D.C. guard on January the 6th. They both bring something different to the police board than that board has had in the past. I don't think that board is perfectly structured, but I do think those two people with the architect of the Capitol, Naval Academy graduate Brett Blanton, who was in charge of building projects at both of the airports before he took this job, at Dulles and National, has a great security background. So, I think we ought to be listening to them and we also ought to be looking at what we do to make that police board work more functionally when there is a moment of crisis. And all three of them are distracted in other ways at that time. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR:  Let's talk about President Biden's infrastructure proposal. Your leader, Mitch McConnell, has already signaled Republicans are going to oppose those proposals. But polls show that investing more in roads, bridges, high speed rail, broadband is widely popular. Any worry that the GOP is on the wrong side of this issue? BLUNT:  Well, I’m actually for all of that. If the proposal was to do just that, I don't think there’d be a problem with the bipartisan group of supporters for this package. I’ve reached out to the White House a couple of times now and said, you've got an easy bipartisan win here if you'll keep this package nearly focused on infrastructure, and then the other 70 or so percent of the package that doesn't have very much too do with infrastructure, if you want to force that in a partisan way, you can still do that. Why would you pass up the opportunity here to focus on roads, bridges, what's happening underground as well as above the ground on infrastructure, broadband, all of which wouldn’t be 40 percent of this package, and that would be a stretch I think to get all of those things to 40 percent. There's more in the package, George, for charging stations for electric vehicles, $174 billion, than there is for roads, bridges and airports and ports. When people think about infrastructure, they're thinking about roads, bridges, ports and airports. That's a very small part of what they're calling an infrastructure package that does so much more than infrastructure that -- I understand the dynamic of taking a popular title and put it, wrapping it around a bill that it's a fairly small percentage of, but it's the difference of whether you have a bipartisan, easy win or a very partisan, broad-based $2.25 trillion package. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But that leaves the question of how to pay for it, and the Republicans are against the tax increase and corporate tax increase that President Biden is proposing, raising it back to 28 percent, which is still below where it was before President Trump's tax cuts. The stock market is booming now. Corporate stocks are up. So, isn't this a good time to invest some of those profits in the future? And if not a corporate tax increase, then how would you pay for it? BLUNT:  Well, it would be a corporate tax increase. Of course, we go back to the second -- first or second highest corporate tax in the world which works to our disadvantage. As businesses are thinking about resourcing and bringing things back to the United States, restructuring how their companies are put together, the corporate tax is an important element of that. Every Republican in the Senate who was there in 2017 voted for the 2017 tax bill. To ask them to turn around, and within less than four years, turn that around is a very unlikely thing to happen. But, again, if you went back to infrastructure and looked at the way we traditionally functioned -- financed the infrastructure of the country and added to that, some public-private partnerships. I’ve introduced a bill with Senator Bennet in the past and Senator Warner in the past, a slightly different bill that would get us new funding sources, figuring out how if you're going to spend all this money on electric vehicles which I think is part of the future, we need to figure out how electric vehicles pay for using the system just like gas-powered vehicles have always paid for it with a gas tax. It's a system that -- you can figure out how that part of the system supports itself, and again, then you can have a bigger, different fight on all the other things this bill purports to do. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Senator Blunt, thanks for your time this morning. BLUNT:  You bet. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is up next. Plus, our powerhouse roundtable. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): If we're looking at ideals and what we think is the actual investment that can create tens of millions of good union jobs in this country that can shore up our health care, our infrastructure, our housing, we're talking about realistically $10 trillion over ten years. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The last thing the economy needs right now is a big whopping tax increase on all the productive sections of our economy. I'm going to fight them every step of the way because I think this is the wrong prescription for America. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Debate is joined on President Biden's infrastructure bill. We just heard from Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri. Now we're joined by one of the cabinet members leading the charge for this bill, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Secretary Buttigieg, thanks for joining us this morning. You just heard Senator Blunt right there said, if you really focused on core infrastructure, you might have a chance of passing this. And it is true that only about 5 percent of this bill goes for traditional roads and bridges. You've got 20 percent caregiving for the elderly, about 13 percent for investments in -- in like the green new deal. So why not focus on that traditional core infrastructure? PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: Well, let's be clear, there's a lot more than roads and bridges that are part of infrastructure. I heard the governor of South Dakota recently saying this isn't infrastructure. It's got money for pipes. Well, we believe that pipes are infrastructure because you need water to live and too many families now live with the threat of lead poisoning. That's absolutely infrastructure. You know, you talk about roads and bridges, but also airports and ports. We need to make sure that we have broadband. I know that traditionally the Internet wasn't considered infrastructure because in the Eisenhower years, of course, it didn't exist. But infrastructure investment has to include looking to the future. Railroads seemed futuristic and then we actually built them. Now they're considered traditional infrastructure. You could say the same about highways. And I've got a lot of respect for Senator Blunt, but I'm going to work to try to persuade him that electrical vehicle charging infrastructure is absolutely a core part of how Americans are going to need to get around in the future, and not the distant, far off future, but right now. STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you're going to work hard to persuade him. Didn't get any Republicans, though, on the original relief bill. Is it a realistic prospect to expect Republicans are going to come around now? BUTTIGIEG: I think it can be. I'm having a lot of conversations with Republicans in the House and Senate who have been wanting to do something big on infrastructure for years.  We may not agree about every piece of it, but this is one area where the American people absolutely want to see us get it done, where members on both sides of the aisle have been talking about getting it done for a long time. And in my view, this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment.  I don't think, in the next 50 years, we're going to see another time when we have this combination of a demonstrated need, bipartisan interest, widespread impatience and a very supportive president who is committed, by the way, not just to the infrastructure itself but to the jobs we're going to create. And independent analysis by economists earlier -- last week -- said that this will lead to 19 million jobs.  And one of the most interesting things is that a lot of the research is also saying that the majority of those jobs will not require a college degree. That's critically important because of all of the changes that are already happening to labor and -- and to manufacturing in this country, to be creating and supporting those jobs for the future. So, yes, I think this is something that everybody can get behind, and we're going to keep working to try to earn that support across the aisle. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There is some... BUTTIGIEG:  One way or the other, we've got to get it done. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There is some skepticism out there in some parts of the labor community.  Shawn Steffee from the Boilermakers Local 154 in Pennsylvania talked about this focus green new jobs.  And he said, ""They keep saying, we're going to transition you into solar jobs.  That's not how it works.  We build power plants, petrochemical plants and maintain steel mills.  Would you ask Tom Brady to play middle linebacker just because he's a football player?"" BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah, I'm not saying we're going to take a machinist and turn them into a computer programmer.  What I'm saying is that we're going to have jobs for insulators on these building retrofits and painters and -- and carpenters, all good union jobs. We're going to have auto workers, union auto workers, I hope, making cars one way or the other.  Why not have them leading the revolution into electric vehicles, which, by the way, there is a very hot competition for with China and a lot of other places. We're not talking about extremely mysterious job creation here.  We're talking about jobs that already exist that we can understand.  If you're a specialist in -- in dealing with mining, we've got to cap a lot of mines, too, and that's going to create a lot of jobs. So I understand there is hesitation, especially because, you know, frankly, there have been a lot of moments where promises have not been kept to labor, which is one of the reasons why I think having the most pro-labor president we've had in a very long time is going to work very well for workers.  And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing workers right there alongside a lot of other advocacy and community groups lining up in support of this bill. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The biggest debates now are over how to pay for it.  The margins are narrow.  If you don't get any Republicans to vote for those tax increases, you need every Democrat.  But senators like Joe Manchin have already signaled that a 28 percent corporate tax is too high.  You can't pass it without every Democratic senator, if Republicans are opposed? BUTTIGIEG:  I think we're going to find a really good, strong, deal space on this.  Because, again, most Americans want to get it done.  And -- and one of the things that's really striking -- you know, I don't spend too much time looking at polls, but I saw some research come back showing that the American people like this plan even more when you explain how we're going to pay for it. And the reason is simple, which is that corporations, we all know, have not been paying their fair share.  A lot of multinational corporations have been paying zero on billions of dollars in profits.  They're -- they're paying more than a firefighter or a -- sorry --less than a firefighter or a school teacher, not just in percent terms, but in dollar terms, and that's wrong. So we're going to reset the corporate tax rate to a rate that is, by the way, still lower than it's been for most of my lifetime, and has been a rate where America has been perfectly competitive for decades, and in doing that, create again, by some estimates, 19 million good-paying jobs, most of which don't require somebody to have a college degree. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Several House Democrats, though, have said they won't support the bill unless you reinstate the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, probably enough to sink the bill if they don't support it.  What do you say to those Democrats? BUTTIGIEG:  Well, look.  We can look at any number of ideas.  We know that this is entering a legislative process where we're going to be hearing from both sides of the aisle, and I think you'll find the president's got a very open mind.  But time is of the essence. So we'll look at these ideas on how to pay for it.  We'll look at ideas on where the investments ought to be, too.  But the president is hoping for major progress from Congress before Memorial Day.  And we can't allow this thing to just keep dragging on, because the need is there today. Each passing day that our infrastructure crumbles, that hurts our economy and it puts our safety in danger.  And, again, the American people are really impatient to get this done.  I'm -- we're determined to make sure that Infrastructure Week is no longer a punchline around Washington.  That's what this robust plan will do.  And it's time for action. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And do those progressives like AOC -- we showed her at the top -- she says $10 trillion is needed right now, this isn't big enough. Your response? BUTTIGIEG:  Yes, there are obviously a lot of people on the other side of the aisle saying, this is too big, too bold. And then some of our friends on our side of the aisle are saying it should be even bolder. Again, that's a natural part of this conversation and this process. But let me stress, this is the biggest investment in American job creation proposed or, if achieved, since World War II. This is a huge deal. And what it would mean to have 10,000 bridges around America replaced, what it would mean -- or improved -- what it would mean to get broadband out to every single American, what it would mean to have zero lead pipes remaining in those water service lines is absolutely enormous, as is that 19 million job figure. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Buttigieg, thanks for your time this morning. BUTTIGIEG:  Thanks for having me. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The roundtable is next. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  The roundtable has already gotten started here. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R), GEORGIA:  Major League Baseball put the wishes of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden ahead of the economic wellbeing of hardworking Georgians who were counting on the all-star game for a paycheck. MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), ATLANTA, GEORGIA:  You can't expect to take these extreme actions of limiting the access to the right to vote when we've talked so much about expanding access for our democracy and not expect that people like Major League Baseball will not take action in return. (END VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR:  The latest fallout from that new Georgia voting law, Major League Baseball and moving the all-star game. One of the things we're going to talk about it on our roundtable. We're joined by Chris Christie, Rahm Emanuel, the CEO of Democracy for America, Yvette Simpson. And we want to welcome Sarah Isgur, our newest ABC News analyst. She’s a veteran of the Trump Justice Department, also political analyst for “The Dispatch”. Chris, let me begin with you. You have a baseball affiliation now, one of the newest members of the Mets board. Was this the right move for the MLB? CHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Listen, it's just a symptom, George. It's a symptom of what's going on in our country right now. I mean, let's talk about what the Georgia law is really about because we haven't had much of that. Drop boxes now become a permanent part of the Georgia landscape. They were not prior to COVID. They are now. Minimum of 17 days of early voting, including two Saturdays and two optional Sundays. You're going to have all voters being able to have multiple ways to prove who they are, driver's license, last four numbers of your Social Security number, even a utility bill or a free ID provided by the state of Georgia, and voting is going to be until -- from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. as it is right now in Georgia. This is what we -- STEPHANOPOULOS:  So, what is this a symptom of? It sounds like you’re against -- CHRISTIE:  It’s a symptom of, it’s a symptom of this, George. And I hate to come in here this morning to say this because I sat here and listened to the president's inaugural address. And I just want a couple of real quick points from it. Politics need not be a raging fire that destroys everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war, and we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated or made up. And Joe Biden's broken his own rule, 84 days. And now, he's lying to the American people, George. He's lying about this bill. He's lying to the American people about it to cause the raging fire he said he was going to put out. I’m very disappointed. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yvette, he did make some misstatements about the bill. The bill basically, though, restricts access to early -- not to early voting but to absentee ballots, but it does expand early voting. YVETTE SIMPSON, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I mean, it depends on how you think about it. You know, you have to pick between a Saturday or a Sunday and what we know about early voting is a lot of folks appreciate, expect and depend on that weekend voting. We know that Sundays are a time when a lot of churches do go. So, the fact that you have to pick between the two is a challenge. It still does not address voter purging which is a big significant issue and there are not enough drop boxes, in fact. Part of the challenge was, yes, you've solidified it, but no, you have not provided sufficient drop boxes for folks. So, it -- let’s stop and back up and say, first, the motivation was not to do more. The motivation was actually to do less. We know that voter fraud was not an issue. And so, this just the motivation enough was enough, and I don't think this goes far enough. I think that, you know, what do we need to do to make sure early voting gets expanded? Seventeen days is not enough early voting. CHRISTIE:  Well, Stacey Abrams, by the way, Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days. Half, half of what Georgia is. Yet she's on TV in New Jersey -- I saw it myself -- saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we've ever seen, but this is Jim Crow? I’m sorry, George. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She’s not -- she's not for moving the all-star game. But, Sarah, one of the interesting things we’re seeing here is not just Major League Baseball. It's Delta. It’s Coca-Cola. It does appear here that corporate America is out of step with the Republican base. SARAH ISGUR, ABC NEWS ANALYST:  That's certainly true, but I think that Republicans have stumbled on a pretty good message here which is Delta, Coke, et cetera, these corporations coming out and condemning the Georgia bill, which, as you said, is ridiculous compared to other states. Delaware, Joe Biden's home state, didn't even have early voting in 2020. They won't have it until 2022. They're condemning that. They're condemning this Georgia bill without really understanding it. Joe Biden has been labeled a recidivist liar for what he has said about the bill by the fact checking organizations. And what about China? We have actual concentration camps going on in China and these corporations won't say word one about it. And the hypocrisy of that, I think, is very clear to a Republican base that this isn't about whether the feel strongly about a Georgia bill that doesn't do what the Democrats are afraid it will do and it doesn't do what the Republicans want it to do, by the way. But, at the same time, unwilling to say word one about China because that's where the money is. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC ""THIS WEEK"" ANCHOR: They wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't in their corporate interest. YVETTE SIMPSON, DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA CEO AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. RAHM EMANUEL, (D) FORMER MAYOR OF CHICAGO AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the -- you've got to put this in a lineage. Also, if you go back four years ago, when North Carolina changed their laws as related to bathrooms, corporations then took a -- pressure in isolating North Carolina. That's also the situation here. It's a shot across the bar to every other state that's looking at changing the laws. They're trying to fix the problem that did not happen. SIMPSON: Right. EMANUEL: And one of the worst part -- that is the fundamental. There was no problem and they're coming up -- it's like -- they're coming up with the solution to a problem that doesn't exist. And it's a shot across the bow to a bunch of other states. And the worst case that this bill, which none of you have mentioned, is the fact that the state legislature wants to overrule both the secretary of states (INAUDIBLE). They're -- for what -- what other reason. I'll repeat what I said last week, which is, if Donald Trump would have won Georgia, there'd be no change in the law. And the fact that because Joe Biden won that this is -- look, it's a, you know -- ISGUR: If Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams were saying that, I think we'd have a very frank (ph) conversation. CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right. EMANUEL: I have no problem fixing the -- there's a lot of problems to fix. This was not a problem to fix. ISGUR: But they're not. Joe Biden said, it ended early voting. It doesn't end early voting. CHRISTIE: This is -- it expands early voting in Georgia. The president said it ended it. Listen, he's what Joe Biden's got to live with when he wakes up this morning on Easter morning. He is doing exactly what he sat around in the campaign and the transition and accused Donald Trump of doing. He is lying to cause racial divisions in this country. That's what he accused Donald Trump of doing and he's a liar and a hypocrite this morning (ph). EMANUEL: Yes, wait -- so, hold on -- hold on -- STEPHANOPOULOS: Then how do you explain why Major League Baseball is making the move? CHRISTIE: It's a business judgment, George. It's a business judgement. Major League Baseball has to make a decision about what is in their best business interest. And I'm sure that's what -- EMANUEL: Chris -- CHRISTIE: I haven't spoken to anybody there, but I'm sure it's what this is (ph). STEPHANOPOULOS: If it -- if it's in their best business interest, doesn't that suggest that there's something wrong with the law? CHRISTIE: No. What it suggests is that's the climate in this country right now. That's the climate of what it is. SIMPSON: You should ask the people who know. You should ask the people who know. I've been doing voter protection for 10 years. Just the idea that you can't give people water in line. I know people's babies -- CHRISTIE: No, that's just not true. ISGUR: That is (INAUDIBLE) -- CHRISTIE: That's not true. SIMPSON: I have held people's babies while they go in to vote in order to enfranchise the vote. Do it by -- do it by all (INAUDIBLE). CHRISTIE: You can't do electioneering -- excuse me. That's -- I'm sorry, that's just wrong. EMANUEL: I'm -- STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, within 20 -- I think it's within 25 feet. CHRISTIE: A hundred and fifty feet, where, in New Jersey, in Chicago and any place else in the country, you're not -- he's saying partisan groups cannot do electioneering by giving out food and water. And in the Georgia bill says that there can be water provided by the state of Georgia, just not by partisan groups. EMANUEL: Two things, George. ISGUR: Also, look, that's a stupid part of the bill, but it's not a threat to democracy. CHRISTIE: And this is the kind of stuff that -- EMANUEL: Two things. Two things. Two things. Two things. SIMPSON: Every time you try to restrict voting rights it's a threat to democracy. ISGUR: But that's no restricting voting right. CHRISTIE: (INAUDIBLE) EMANUEL: Two things. SIMPSON: And the fact that they didn't address the elephant in the room, which is voter purging. A hundred an ninety-eight thousand African-Americans Georgians were purged from the rolls. EMANUEL: Well, wait -- ISGUR: But that's now what Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams have been complaining of. CHRISTIE: Yes, look -- STEPHANOPOULOS: Rahm. EMANUEL: I feel like a middle child at a dinner or breakfast. SIMPSON: Always. STEPHANOPOULOS: You really have a hard time getting in. EMANUEL: Two things. CHRISTIE: Yes, everyone feels bad for you, Rahm. EMANUEL: One is -- one is you said that corporate America is out of step with the Republican Party. Corporate America has no home in the Republican Party anymore. And this is the first of many times where corporate America is going to make a clear decision. And it's a wakeup call to every other state. Second is, Joe Biden is not a liar. CHRISTIE: Yes, he is. EMANUEL: No, no, no. SIMPSON: (INAUDIBLE). EMANUEL: And coming from a -- you know, we just spent four years with a person who had literally couldn't find the truth if it actually -- it went choo-choo in front of him in the morning. CHRISTIE: Is -- EMANUEL: Joe Biden, you may disagree with his characterization. CHRISTIE: Did we restrict early voting? EMANUEL: He is not a lie. SIMPSON: It does restrict early voting. EMANUEL: You may disagree with his characterization. That bill is only done -- passed for one reason, because Joe Biden won Georgia and the two senators won Georgia. CHRISTIE: He lied. He lied, Rahm, and he's going to have to live with it. EMANUEL: That is not. He has not. CHRISTIE: Yes, he is. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about the infrastructure bill right now. We're seeing the first flurries of this, Sarah, so let begin with you here. It appears that Biden is going to go full speed ahead. The biggest, boldest program. Not worry right now about getting the Republicans on board. ISGUR: And a very different Republican message then when we saw Barack Obama come into office in 2009. They went straight at Obamacare and took what could have been a very popular piece of legislation through messaging and a lot of consistent messaging from every person in the Republican Party, drove down the popularity of that bill. So instead of being a legislative accomplishment, it really hung around the necks of Democrats in the midterms. With the American Recovery Act that we saw last month, Republicans were talking about Dr. Seuss. It will be very interesting. Mitch McConnell and McCarthy, they want to go after this bill and message about how it's not really infrastructure, that only 5 percent is going to traditional infrastructure. Will the rest of the Republican Party follow suit? STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and you just -- ISGUR: Or are they going to be talking about the all-star game? STEPHANOPOULOS: And you just heard -- EMANUEL: Right. STEPHANOPOULOS: A, but you also just heard Roy Blunt saying, wait, I love a lot of the infrastructure as well because they know so much of the individual investments in this bill are popular. ISGUR:  And they're no longer the party of fiscal restraint. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, both parties have given that up. EMANUEL:  Look, I mean, Joe Biden made a very clear statement.  If you want a 21st Century economy, you can't have a mid-20th Century foundation.  And if it runs on roads, rails or runways, we're going to get you there on time. And it's very, very popular, because the American -- look, right now in Jackson, Mississippi, you can't get fresh water.  You can't -- if you're in rural America, you can't get your child on the Internet for school. And all of us know, all of us know parents can't get to soccer games or after-school activities on time; they have to budget an extra 20 minutes because of all the congestion and all the problems.  So it's very popular there. The other thing that he has done very well at the White House, on the relief bill, it was all about COVID.  On infrastructure, if you vote no, you're with China.  If you vote yes, you're with America.  And they're picking the right enemies for each of these battles. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Chris Christie, Republican governors, not in exactly the same place... CHRISTIE:  No... STEPHANOPOULOS:  ... as Republicans in Washington? CHRISTIE:  No.  Look, how many times have we said this on this program?  If you're going to give governors, Republican, Democrat or independent, money from Washington that they don't have to get by raising taxes themselves?  Amen, baby. (LAUGHTER) They're all going to say it, and I don't care whether you're talking about the most conservative Republican governor in America or the most moderate Republican governor. EMANUEL:  There's a born-again Republican, right there. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTIE:  They're going to say -- they're going to say ""Give me the money."" ISGUR:  Right this way. CHRISTIE:  That's what governors always do.  Because then they don't have to raise taxes themselves.  But here's the problem.  And again, it goes along with the deceit of this White House.  And there is no doubt there's deceit.  The COVID bill, a fraction of the COVID bill was about COVID.  Now we have an infrastructure bill.  A fraction of the infrastructure bill is about infrastructure.  About... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, but it depends on how you define infrastructure. (CROSSTALK) CHRISTIE:  Oh, no, now the care economy is infrastructure, George -- the care economy.  I don't even know what the hell the care economy is.  But, you know what, it's now a huge part of an infrastructure bill. EMANUEL:  I think you need to go to services for Easter.  You're a little worked up here. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTIE:  I was praying already for you this morning, Rahm, believe me. EMANUEL:  I can feel it. (LAUGHTER) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Is the care economy not infrastructure? SIMPSON:  Well, let's talk about why this is important.  We know that, without ending the filibuster, we're not going to be able to get legislation passed outside of reconciliation.  And so what progressives are concerned about is you give moderate Democrats and give Republicans everything they want in that bill, and then how do you come back and get the things that you need, like Medicare, extended child care, all the things that we know are the human infrastructure, the human economy. And so that's why we're concerned that it doesn't go far enough.  In addition, we think that we need to make a bigger downpayment on climate infrastructure. We just saw what happened in Texas.  Last year wildfires raged almost the entire Pacific coast.  So we know that, you know, we can talk about it in a vacuum; we can think about the fact that we don't need to do more, and then we see the real effects. Right now -- you talked about water.  Kids in Flint, Michigan... EMANUEL:  Right, definitely. SIMPSON:  ... and in the rural South who still can't get clean water.  We need to make a significant investment, and that's why progressives are supporting the THRIVE Agenda, which is $10 million over the next.... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Let me just ask Sarah a question.  First, let me come to -- is there a chance -- let me ask you the question I asked Roy Blunt right at the top.  The Republicans will pay a price for opposing a program that seems, right now, broadly popular? ISGUR:  Well, again, go back to 2009.  If they are able to actually message around this bill, which I'm not convinced they'll do --Christie makes great points, but you're not seeing a whole lot of Republicans make those points in a consistent, drumbeat fashion.  But what they were able to do in 2009 to Obamacare paid huge dividends in the 2010 midterms.  That was one of the biggest freshman Republican classes in history. So, absolutely, Republicans have a way to turn this to their political advantage.  Will they take that?  And have they lost that moral high ground over spending when, for the last four years, they were on a spending spree and Donald Trump didn't care about spending? EMANUEL:  Here's the -- here's the thing.  Comparing 2009 or 2010 and the midterm, the fact is this infrastructure is not about healthcare.  And everybody who lives through the problems that we have today around America's transportation system, water system, Internet or energy distribution -- and that is a real, real problem in America and people know it has to be... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  But does that mean the home health care workers is coming out... (CROSSTALK) EMANUEL:  But here's -- here's the point that I think is important in this, and you get to the point of Republicans.  They -- what is designed in this bill, and you even see in the relief bill that was first done, 25 percent to 30 percent, depending on what you'll get, of Republicans support it. They -- what the Biden White House is doing -- and still do -- what the Biden Republicans -- what Biden has figured out is he is driving a wedge between the Republican establishment and Republican voters.  He's telling you up front exactly what he's doing.  And each bill, which is why not only is he popular but what he has done on both the vaccine, the economy, and Friday's jobs numbers are only going to give him further wind in the sail why we've got to make this investment.  And it's popular with Republicans. CHRISTIE:  Well, Republicans need to make the argument that this is about 25 percent of $2.2 trillion goes to what he just talked about, roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, Internet.  The rest of the bill goes to a lot of other things, which Yvette is totally for, and that's fine.  Let's make the arguments on the merits for those things and not call them infrastructure. And the last point on it is this.  Yvette brings up the filibuster. Very important. The filibuster that Joe Biden supported, fought for, yelled and screamed for on the floor of the Senate for 36 years, he now calls that Jim Crow. What else is Jim Crow to Joe Biden? SIMPSON:  Well, in this country, a lot. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But all -- but all he's for now is a talking filibuster. He's not for eliminating the filibuster. CHRISTIE:  Now. SIMPSON:  Well, I mean, they're talking infrastructure. I just wanted to go back to what Sarah said. Here's the reason why I don't think Republicans are going to support it, no matter how much candy is in this bill. They have set their sights on opposing everything that Biden does, because that's how they make the claim that they need to take back control in 2022 and 2024. And that's the reason why I think it was ill-advised for Biden to actually put all the things that Republicans want and moderate Democrats want in this reconciliation bill, because, if we can't go back to the well again, now you have got progressives and most Democrats not being able to do the things that we actually need. People... (CROSSTALK) EMANUEL:  And here's the one thing -- here's the one thing Republicans haven't caught up on. Sorry, Sarah. Here's the one thing Republicans haven't caught up, which is a real difference. 2009 was a financially -- financing-induced recession. This is a natural disaster. It is a different permission slip to deal with what's ailing America when you have a natural disaster, the virus. You can see like how we respond to New Orleans, how we respond to California or Texas. Americans come to help people who are victims out of no reason for what happens to them because of a natural disaster; '09 was a banker-driven scandal. And what I will say here, we have lost a half-a-million Americans here. Back then, Americans wanted to kill half-a-million bankers, OK? It's a big difference. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sarah, does the fact that the economy is starting to boom -- we just saw 900,000 jobs created this week -- does that help Biden's case to get this done or hurt it? ISGUR:  Ah. (LAUGHTER) ISGUR:  Honestly, I... (LAUGHTER) EMANUEL:  Was that an oy for Passover? Or what was that? (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Chris, do you want to comment on... CHRISTIE:  Very well put, Sarah. Very, very well put. EMANUEL:  I'm so glad they signed you last week. (LAUGHTER) CHRISTIE:  She -- you're already a veteran. SIMPSON:  But yet we still knew what she was saying. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Now she only has seconds, 10 seconds left to answer the question. ISGUR:  All right. Both sides are going to argue that this helps their case, that this is part of their message. You have the Republican base saying, this is the Trump recovery. And you have the Biden folks saying, without me, it would be less than it is. I think, in the end, you have another base election coming in 2022, the same thing we have seen repeated over and over again. You want to talk about the Democrats -- or the Republicans doing everything to stop Biden. Welcome to the last four years of the Democrats. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is going to be the last word. Lively roundtable. Thank you all very much. (LAUGHTER) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Coming up, Martha Raddatz takes a closer look at the effort under way in the U.S. military to rename its bases honoring Confederate leaders. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT:  For the very first time, hundreds of thousands of young people will be experiencing the White House roll through the Internet. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE CHIEFS OF STAFF:  We have to improve the substance of promotions in the military, but we have to take a hard look at the symbology, the symbols. Things like Confederate flags and statues and bases and all that kind of stuff. The Confederacy, the American Civil War was fought, and it was an act of rebellion, an act of treason at the time against the Union. The way we should do it matters as much as if we should do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR:  That was the chairman of Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, on how the military is confronting racism in it ranks and legacy of Confederate symbolism in the military. This week, Virginia’s high court ruled the Charlottesville can take down two more statues and Congress recently created a commission to rename bases named for Confederate generals. Martha Raddatz spoke with two generals who took very different paths to similar conclusions on the controversy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  There stands Jackson like a stone wall, it says, but -- TY SEIDULE, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF HISTORY AT WEST POINT:  You see me rolling my eyes? It's meant to show that he is a hero. Who was he? He’s somebody that fought against his country to support and create a slave society. RADDATZ:  Ty Seidule rolls his eyes today, but growing up in Virginia, he revered Confederate generals. Robert E. Lee was not just a hero to him, but the greatest human to ever walk the Earth. SEIDULE:  On a scale of one to ten, I would have put Lee at about 11. So, it wasn't just that I liked him. I revered him and my entire culture revered him. RADDATZ:  That's Seidule at Washington Lee University where he chose to be commissioned into the Army at the foot of Lee's tomb. SEIDULE:  The altar of that chapel is Robert E. Lee surround by Confederate flags, and I went back and sat down and raised my right hand and took that oath and it's an anti-Confederate oath written in 1862 to ferret out Confederate traitors. RADDATZ:  Did you know about his history in the Confederacy and what he represented? Did you think about that at the time? SEIDULE:  I thought the Confederates were honorable people that lost. It was noble. It was romantic. Oh my God. I was so wrong because I didn't realize what they fought for was slavery. RADDATZ:  His epiphany came years later walking the campus of West Point where he came across the Lee barracks. SEIDULE:  I said, why are these things named after Lee? What I found was that in the 19th century, West Point banished Confederates at traitors. They named nothing after them. In fact, they only come back in the 20th century and they come when African-Americans come back to West Point, and that made me so angry that Confederate memorialization is a reaction against integration. RADDATZ:  Now a professor at West Point and on the commission to rename U.S. military bases, Seidule’s focus is on the sullied history of those confederate generals whose names are emblazoned on U.S. Army bases. Dr. Nadia West knew it all along. She spent much of her Army career at Ft. Bragg. RADDATZ (on camera): Did it occur to you, did you think about those names, did you know who those forts were named after? DR. NADIA WEST: Absolutely. Absolutely. But at some point you think, that's just the way -- that's just the way it is. RADDATZ (voice over): And no wonder. West's entire family, father, siblings and now her son serving in the military. Dr. West, the only African-American, the only woman in her senior class at West Point. WEST: You take an oath to support the defend the Constitution, and then you've got, you know, things named for people who didn't do that. And anytime something happens or some of the ugliness comes up, the comment is, that's not who we are. But, in fact, it is who we are unless we do something about it. RADDATZ: Dr. West eventually becoming the first black female three-star general and highest ranking woman to graduate from West Point. RADDATZ (on camera): It goes without saying you're pretty happy the Army is considering name -- changing all the names, right? WEST: Absolutely. I think it's -- it's important because that's -- what message are we sending? RADDATZ: When you had your epiphany, before that, had you ever thought what it might be like for black officers to walk around those bases? SEIDULE: I never thought of it. And, listen, I -- I -- one of the reasons I'm so passionate about this, I hold myself responsible for this. I didn't see what was -- and I've had black bosses, I had black friends. I saw -- but I didn't understand what it meant. RADDATZ (voice over): Seidule wrote about his evolution in his book, ""Robert E. Lee and Me: A Southerner's Reckoning with the Myth of the Lost Cause."" SEIDULE: History is dangerous because it goes after our myth and our identity. And what I was doing was challenging the Army and West Point about who it is and what it wants to be. And now I am so happy the Army is leading the way. It can't wait to change. West Point can't -- they've already got a plan. RADDATZ (on camera): Are you changing history? SEIDULE: We're changing commemoration. History is what historians do to look at the past to try to understand what happened, but -- but commemoration is who, as a society, do we honor. And we should honor those who lived the value that we cherish today, not those who fought for slavery and treason 160 years ago. RADDATZ (voice over): But that battle is not over. As the country witnessed on January 6th, those symbols of the past are still very much alive today. RADDATZ (on camera): When you saw that confederate battle flag, and -- and I think people don't understand the difference between the confederate flag, and confederate battle flag. SEIDULE: It's the flag of treason. That's what I call it. And when I saw the flag of treason go by there, I tell you, I was ready to put my uniform back on and -- and go there and say -- because, listen, we don't do rebellion in the United States of America, we don't do insurrection. WEST: It was the surreal nature to it, is this really happening in the United States of America? RADDATZ: Any final thoughts on where we'll be as a country, where the Army will be after this changes? WEST: Well, Martha, I'm the eternal optimist. We've seen so much improvement. I think we can get there maybe now that they're like -- their eyes are open and we can have a better dialogue. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Martha for that. That is all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Have a Happy Easter. I'll see you tomorrow on ""GMA.""

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/california-gov-gavin-newsom-pushes-covid-19-vaccination/story?id=76858713,politics,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom patiently waited for the day that all Californians 50 and older became eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination, and on Thursday he received a dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Newsom told ABC News' Zohreen Shah- in an exclusive interview that he was thrilled to be ""one and done,"" as he recalled the first vaccine administered in Southern California, to nurse Helen Cordova, on Dec. 14. ""Eighteen million doses later, it's finally my turn,"" he said. ""Today we're making it eligible for everyone 50 and over. In two weeks, everybody 16 and over. We have that supply now."" Newsom received his vaccine in hard-hit south Los Angeles to emphasize vaccine equity in a community that's suffered immensely throughout the coronavirus pandemic. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, California has reported more coronavirus cases -- more than 3.57 million -- and virus-related deaths -- 58,269 -- than any other state. In Los Angeles County, residents identifying as Hispanic of Latino have accounted for approximately 53% of COVID-19-related deaths despite accounting for 48.6% of the population. ""This is why all our work has to be focused, mindful of the issue of equity, not just as a platform, not just as a promotion, not just as a promise,"" Newsom said. ""It's tough. It's gritty work. It's hard. It's stubborn. We know that as it relates to the issue of testing. Seven, eight months ago, that was our biggest issue -- equity on testing and access to testing opportunities. Now it's the same with vaccines."" Last month, the CDC issued a report that measured county's vaccine rollouts with regards to ""social vulnerability."" The vulnerability index included several factors, including race, education, poverty level and housing, which the agency noted has also been linked to higher coronavirus rates. The report examined roughly 49 million shots distributed between Dec. 14 and March 1. Of the 48 states surveyed, California ranked 44th when it came to vaccinations among residents in the most socially vulnerable counties. To date, California has delivered nearly 19.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, more than any other state. However, it ranks 30th for vaccines administered per 100,000 people. Newsom also added that getting children back to school will be of critical importance in returning to ""normal,"" especially children in minority communities that have been among the hardest hit during the pandemic. ""We have a unique moral responsibility to address systemically, once and for all, not just as a state, but I expect as a nation,"" he added. As California takes step to ease restrictions, coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the state have all declined significantly after peaking earlier this year. Since mid-January, the state's seven-day average of cases has declined by over 94%. But other states have seen surges recently -- two dozen have seen cases increase by at least 10% over the last week while 18 also have seen 10% increases in reported hospital admissions. And cases are increasing elsewhere. In France, for instance, said Newsom, schools and businesses are closing once more because of the virus's mutations and community spread. ""We have to be mindful this disease is not going away. It's not disappeared. It's as virulent. It's as deadly as it's ever been,"" Newsom said. Newsom also addressed the mounting controversy over his handling of the pandemic, which has resulted in an attempted recall election. ""I don't think it advantages the state of California,"" he said. ""Forget the Democratic Party. Forget the current occupant that happens to be the current governor. And so, for me, this is really an assault on California -- California values -- and I hope we can stay united."""
