Its two main sponsors were men. And it died without ever getting out of committee, just 10 days after it was introduced.", "But when Republicans decided to try again in January, they were far more strategic in their approach. The sponsors this time were two women who modeled ", " after a template provided by a conservative legal organization. They gave the bill a name that suggested noble intent: the \u201cact to promote continued fairness in women\u2019s sports.\u201d Supporters from Minnesota and Idaho traveled to the Capitol in Pierre to testify that a new law was urgently needed to keep anyone with male biological characteristics out of female competitions, even though ", " only a handful of examples of that happening in South Dakota.", "\u201cThese efforts appear to be far more slick, and far more organized,\u201d said Elizabeth A. Skarin of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, which opposes the bill. \u201cAnytime they give a bill a name in South Dakota,\u201d she added, \u201cyou know something\u2019s up.\u201d", "Then things took an unexpected turn. Gov. Kristi Noem, who is seen as a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, demanded changes to the bill. The response was swift and harsh: Social conservative activists and Republican lawmakers accused Ms. Noem of bowing to pressure from business and athletics organizations, which have been successful at stopping laws in other states that single out transgender people for exclusion and feed ugly stereotypes. On Monday, the legislature rejected her changes, setting up a showdown that could drag out for several days.", "South Dakota is just one of a growing number of states where Republicans are diving into a culture war clash that seems to have come out of nowhere. It has been brought about by a coordinated and poll-tested campaign by social conservative organizations like the American Principles Project and Concerned Women for America, which say they are determined to move forward with what may be one of their last footholds in the fight against expanding L.G.B.T.Q. rights.", "Three other states have passed bills this month that resemble South Dakota\u2019s. ", " and Arkansas, they are set to become law this summer. And similar bills have been introduced by Republicans in two dozen other states, including North Carolina, where an unpopular \u201c", "\u201d enacted in 2016 prompted ", " and led conservatives nationwide to pull back on efforts to restrict rights for transgender people.", "\u201cYou make change in our society by making laws, and luckily we have some great states that have stepped up,\u201d said Beth Stelzer, the founder of a new organization, Save Women\u2019s Sports, that she said opposes \u201cdemolishing women\u2019s sports for the sake of feelings.\u201d Ms. Stelzer, an amateur power lifter, has testified in support of new laws in South Dakota, Montana and Arkansas.", "But the idea that there is a sudden influx of transgender competitors who are dominating women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports does not reflect reality \u2014 in high school, college or professionally. Sports associations like the N.C.A.A., which has promoted the inclusion of transgender athletes, have policies in place to address concerns about physical differences in male and female biology. The N.C.A.A., ", " who are transitioning to female to be on testosterone suppression treatment for a year before they can compete on a women\u2019s team.", "Ms. Stelzer, who competes in a weight lifting league that does not allow transgender women to participate, says the point is to get ahead of what she and other activists believe will become a bigger issue. \u201cWe\u2019re nipping it in the bud,\u201d she said.", "In high school sports, policies vary widely. Some states pose no barriers to transgender athletes; some have policies similar to those of the N.C.A.A. and others have outright bans or demand that students verify their sex if questioned.", "Rarely has an issue that so few people encounter \u2014 and one that public opinion analysts have only recently ", " in depth \u2014 become a political and cultural flash point so quickly. The lack of awareness creates an environment in which the real impact of transgender participation in sports can be overshadowed by hyperbole.", "But the debate also raises questions \u2014 that ethicists, lawmakers and the courts are only beginning to address \u2014 about whether the decades-long effort to give women and girls equal opportunities in sports is compatible with efforts to give transgender people equal opportunities in life. A lawsuit in federal court in Connecticut brought by three high school runners who lost in competition against transgender girls will be among the first to test how nondiscrimination laws apply.", "A mix of factors has helped social conservatives breathe new life into the issue: activists who agreed to give up on unpopular bills regulating public bathrooms; an awareness that women, not men, could be more persuasive and sympathetic advocates; a new Democratic administration that quickly moved to broaden and restore rights for transgender people that the Trump administration had eliminated; and a political and media culture on the right that often reduces the nuanced issue of gender identity to a punchline about political correctness.", "Activists who have been fighting the anti-transgender efforts say the focus on school athletics is creating a false and misplaced perception of victimization.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that there\u2019s a victim of transness,\u201d said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which was successful in temporarily blocking the implementation of a transgender athlete ban in Idaho last year.", "In fact, studies have shown that the ", " report feeling unsafe at school.", "\u201cWhat we have is a speculative fear of something that hasn\u2019t materialized,\u201d Mr. Strangio, who is a transgender man, added. \u201cThey\u2019re acting like LeBron James is going to put on a wig and play basketball with fourth graders. And not one LeBron James, 100. In reality, you\u2019re talking about little kids who just want to play rec sports. They just want to get through life.\u201d", "But the isolated instances that have been filmed or generated headlines \u2014 female weight lifting records being broken by a new transgender competitor, for example \u2014 make for viral content, bolstered by media personalities with huge followings like Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan.", "The issue is much more widely covered in conservative media \u2014 and often presented with a heavy dose of sarcasm. According to a review of social media content conducted for The New York Times by Media Matters, a left-leaning watchdog, seven of the 10 most popular stories about the proposed laws targeting transgender people so far this year were from the Daily Wire, a website founded by Mr. Shapiro. Two others were from Fox News. Combined, the articles were read, shared and commented on six million times, Media Matters said.", "The heightened media awareness on the right is due in part to how social conservative activists have improved at ", ". Borrowing a page from the anti-abortion movement, which was led by men for much of its early period, they have begun featuring women as public advocates.", "In Arkansas, where the governor signed the ", "into law last week, the leading proponents were the attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, who is a candidate for governor, and the Arkansas Republican Women\u2019s Caucus. The bill will prohibit transgender participation on female teams from kindergarten through college.", "In many instances, lawmakers have worked closely with groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that has argued several Supreme Court cases on behalf of people claiming discrimination because of their traditional beliefs about marriage and gender roles. ", "In the case in Idaho, opponents of the law argued that it was exclusionary, discriminatory and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing two female college runners who said they had \u201cdeflating experiences\u201d after losing to a transgender woman, agreed that the case was about equality, but in the context of creating \u201ca level playing field,\u201d said Kristen Waggoner, the group\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWhen the law ignores the legitimate differences that exist between men and women, it creates chaos,\u201d she added. ", "Limiting the rights of transgender people is an issue that has resonance with an increasingly small share of the overall population. ", " by the Public Religion Research Institute reported that only 7 percent of Americans were \u201ccompletely against\u201d pro-L.G.B.T.Q. policies. But it is a vocal group intent on showing that it can flex its power in the Republican Party.", "Ms. Noem is now at odds with most Republicans in the legislature. Though she initially said she was \u201cexcited\u201d to sign their bill as is, she is now demanding that they leave college athletes out of any new law. ", "Social conservative organizations went on the attack, taking aim at her apparent presidential ambitions . \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Gov. Noem has national aspirations, so it\u2019s time she hears from a national audience,\u201d the Family Policy Alliance, an affiliate of Focus on the Family, wrote in an email to supporters.", "Ms. Noem appeared to be aware of how damaging it could be to have conservatives think she was on the wrong side of the issue.", "On Thursday, she and her advisers joined a hastily arranged conference call with members of the Conservative Action Project, which includes leaders of the largest right-wing groups in the country. Ms. Noem expressed concern that if she signed the law, the N.C.A.A. would retaliate against South Dakota, as it did with North Carolina, by refusing to hold tournaments there, according to one person on the call.", "The activists were respectful but clear, this person said: this was not what they expected from the conservative firebrand they had come to admire so much."], "author": "Jeremy W.
