Fox News obtained a copy in advance of its publication. During what Hunter describes as ""more than four years of active addiction"" with intermittent failed attempts to get clean, he fathered a child with a stripper who worked at a Washington, D.C., club at the time.  The younger Biden mentioned the woman and her child as he was explaining in his book that he'd had very little in the way of meaningful romantic relationships for most of his adult life.  ""It was my first actual date in 26 years,"" Hunter said of a blind date with a woman named Kathleen, who he would later marry. ""My relationship with [Beau's widow] Hallie belonged to a whole other category, and the other women I'd been with during rampages since my divorce were hardly the dating type. We'd satisfy our immediate needs and little else."" He added: ""I'm not proud of it. It's why I would later challenge in court the woman from Arkansas who had a baby in 2018 and claimed the child was mine -- I had no recollection of our encounter. That's how little connection I had with anyone. I was a mess, but a mess I've taken responsibility for.""  That Biden was the father of this child was more than a claim by the mother.  Independence County, Ark., Circuit Judge Holly Meyer   The order said that DNA tests made that fact clear.  ""[T]he results of the DNA tests indicate with near scientific certainty that the defendant is the biological father of the child in this case,"" the order said.  Biden remembering little has become a recurring theme as he promotes his book.  In multiple interviews with CBS that aired on Sunday and Monday, Hunter claimed that he had ""no idea"" whether the laptop first reported on last fall by the New York Post as containing damning information about his business affairs was his.  ""Of course, certainly,"" the president's son said when asked whether the laptop ""could"" be his. But, he added, ""It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me."" CBS also asked Biden whether he dropped the laptop off at a repair shop in Delaware, where it was found.  ""No. Not that I remember at all. At all,"" he said. ""So, we'll see."""
https://www.foxnews.com//politics/supreme-court-dismisses-trump-twitter-case-moot,politics,"The   on Monday deemed former President  's appeal of a ruling that said it was unconstitutional for him to block critics moot, after a lower court considered his page to be a protected public forum The court called for the case to be dismissed, as Trump is no longer in office and Twitter has blocked him from the platform. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with the decision in light of Trump no longer being president, but the conservative jurist illustrated the complexity of the matter given that Trump ultimately did not have full control over his own account. ""[I]t seems rather odd to say that something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it,"" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion.  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled against Trump, claiming that as president, he used his Twitter account to discuss political matters and therefore the interactive participation of commenting on his tweets was considered a public forum protected by the First Amendment. Blocking those who criticized him, therefore, was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, they had ruled. Thomas noted that while Trump had the power to block other users, Twitter was then able to block ""all Twitter users from interacting with his messages"" by banning his account altogether. ""Because unbridled control of the account resided in the hands of a private party, First Amendment doctrine may not have applied to respondents’ complaint of stifled speech,"" Thomas pointed out, stating that ""[w]hether governmental use of private space implicates the First Amendment often depends on the government’s control over that space."" Thomas acknowledged how modern technology is not always easily addressed by existing legal doctires, and warned that the Supreme Court ""will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms."" With that in mind, he cautioned that the power wielded by social media giants like Twitter poses its own issues. ""The Second Circuit feared that then-President Trump cut off speech by using the features that Twitter made available to him,"" Thomas said. ""But if the aim is to ensure that speech is not smothered, then the more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves. As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms. The extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions."""
https://www.foxnews.com//politics/biden-cancel-student-debt-50000-progressive-pressure,politics,"Progressives are ramping up the pressure on   to forgive student debt relief as   Secretary Miguel Cardona investigates the administration's legal authority to cancel some of the $1.7 trillion in student loan debt.

The   said Biden does not support debt relief above $10,000 for all borrowers. ""The president does not favor $50,000 in student loan relief without limitation,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News last week.  Any debt relief above $10,000 would have to be targeted, ""based on the borrower’s income, based on the kind of debt in question,"" the White House said.  White House chief of staff   Thursday that Cardona is preparing a report for the president on his legal authority to cancel student debt.  ""He asked his secretary of  , who’s just been on the job a few weeks, once he got on the job to have his department prepare a memo on the president’s legal authority, and hopefully we’ll see that in the next few weeks,"" Klain told Politico.

But a   from the leader of a House conservative caucus regarding Biden’s own tax loopholes could foreshadow what Republicans will include in their oversight agenda should they flip the House of Representatives in 2022. ""House Democrats used their oversight power to subpoena Trump for his tax returns, but they’ve completely ignored Joe Biden’s abuse of our tax code,"" Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., told Fox News. ""When we take back the House in 2022, Oversight [Committee] Republicans won’t forget about Biden’s legally dubious tax avoidance schemes."" As a private citizen in 2017, 2018 and 2019, Biden and first lady Jill Biden routed $13 million in income through two S-corporations – CelticCapri Corporation and the Giacoppa Corporation – to avoid paying taxes that help fund Medicare and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as ObamaCare. While entirely legal, Biden has advocated eliminating such loopholes, while also promoting the expansion of both Medicare and ObamaCare. The Banks letter to Biden asked, ""Do you intend to undo your hypocrisy and pay these taxes back to the American people?"" ""Press reports indicate that you both directed revenue from book royalties and speaking appearance fees into these two corporations avoiding self-employment payroll tax liabilities that would have flowed to America’s Medicare program that provides care to over 60 million seniors,"" reads the letter, dated March 25. In the minority, congressional Republicans – many of whom have called for oversight of Biden’s handling of the border crisis or of potential conflicts of interest regarding his son Hunter Biden’s overseas business – lack the authority to compel Biden or his administration to provide information on any matter. But, as Americans witnessed during the previous administration, the issues Democrats continuously talked about in 2017 and 2018 – including President Trump’s taxes – became fodder for investigative hearings after Democrats held a House majority beginning in 2019. The Biden tax savings demonstrate ""Democrat hypocrisy is limitless,"" Banks said, contrasting this with both the president’s public policies and the working-class image Biden cultivated throughout his political career. ""The ACA imposed higher taxes on millions of Americans, but not Joe Biden. He paid $121,000 less in ObamaCare taxes thanks to an obscure tax loophole. Talk about inside baseball,"" Banks told Fox News. ""Joe Biden advocated for expanding Medicare, and is pushing to close tax loopholes and for a $3 trillion tax hike. At the same time, ‘Amtrak Joe’ made $13 million through speaking fees in just three years, then skimped over $500,000 from Medicare recipients through tax loopholes."" The Wall Street Journal   the first couple’s tax move in July that saved them as much as $500,000. The newspaper said the Bidens avoided paying 3.8% in Medicare payroll taxes by moving book royalties and speaking-related income into an S-corporation. An  , under IRS rules, is a partnership with fewer than 100 shareholders. The company may pass income directly to shareholders to avoid double taxation. Combined, CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. reported profits of more than $13 million for 2017 and 2018, the Journal reported, not subject to self-employment taxes. The companies paid the Bidens less than $800,000 in salaries. ""Your hypocrisy is highlighted by the fact that Medicare faces significant funding shortfalls,"" the Banks letter from last week says. ""Just this year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated its Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will face insolvency in the middle of Fiscal Year 2026—roughly five years from now."" ""Moreover, during the presidential campaign, you said ‘ObamaCare is personal to me,’"" the letter adds. ""And your administration has sought to expand ObamaCare wherever possible. Yet, you and your wife avoided paying $121,000 in Obamacare payroll taxes."" The White House did not respond to an inquiry from Fox News on this matter. But in July, the Biden campaign told the Journal, ""As demonstrated by their effective federal tax rate in 2017 and 2018—which exceeded 33 percent—the Bidens are committed to ensuring that all Americans pay their fair share."" Notably, this information came to light because the Bidens released their tax returns, which Trump never did — prompting Democratic investigations. Biden has a history of calling for high-income Americans to pay more in taxes. When running for vice president on a Democratic ticket with Barack Obama in 2008, Biden told CBS News’ Kate Snow in an interview that those earning more than $250,000 should ""pay more,""  ""It's time to be patriotic, Kate, time to jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut."" During his 2020 Democratic National Convention acceptance speech in August, Biden called for ""ending loopholes"" for the wealthy. ""Because we don't need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I’m not looking to punish anyone,""   in the acceptance speech. ""Far from it. But it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share."""

Now, here's where Pelosi comes into play.

For example, she has held calls with major world leaders like Canadian Prime Minister   and Israel's  . Since the beginning of the administration and a week after Biden's announcement, Harris has fielded questions from the media but has yet to hold a formal news conference. Meanwhile, the border crisis captivated the nation's attention and raised a series of concerns about national security and the stability of the U.S. immigration system as a whole. When Biden initially announced her appointment, he said she would be in charge of working to return migrants to their home countries. ""So this new surge we're dealing with now started with the last administration, but it's our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to – and to stop what's happening,"" Biden said month.

He was lonely on the road. He was 22 and felt like he had to carry himself like a ""seasoned campaigner."" MacIntyre was losing the joy of sport. Back home in Oban, a tiny coastal town on the western edge of the Scottish Highlands, he sat down his parents and and told them he needed a change. ""I wasn't going to be giving up the game,"" he said. ""But it was going to take a back seat just now. I was going to take a few weeks off. I could see my dad looking at me. He knew what was coming. I said, ‘I’m going back to playing shinty.'"" It's   as old as Scotland, which MacIntyre once described as a combination of field hockey and legalized violence. It more closely resembles the rough-and-tumble Irish sport of hurling. Both are more dangerous than golf. ""It was a bit scary,"" his mother, Carol, said of the family meeting. ""But it's in his blood to play shinty."" His grandfather, Dougie MacIntyre Sr., was regarded as among the best to ever play. His father (Dougie) and uncle (Gordon) scored all three goals when Oban Camanachd won its last league title in 1996, the year MacIntyre was born. So instead of playing the China Open, he trained on Tuesday and Thursday and played a shinty match on Saturday. The next day, he drove to Southport, England, for the British Masters and tied for second. Then it was back to shinty, with drills and practice on Tuesday and Thursday and the game on Saturday. Then he flew to Denmark and finished second again in golf, one shot behind Bernd Wiesberger. ""In shinty, it can get rough, tough, aggressive. But it keeps the fight in you,"" MacIntyre said. ""All you need is one good shot to turn it around. That's what it's like on the golf course. That's the background I'm from. It gives me that fight and drive to achieve what I want to do."" He recalls being criticized for taking such a risk as a golfer. He also remembers his reply. ""Some people take drugs, drink, the lot,"" he said. ""My drug is shinty."" His job is golf, and those two weeks of feeling like a kid again — riding the bus with his pals, singing and having a few beers on the way home — renewed his purpose and his fight. He went on to win the Sir Henry Cotton Award as the European Tour rookie of the year in 2019. He won in Cyprus last year for his first European Tour victory and kept moving up in the world ranking until he cracked the top 50. Next stop: Augusta National for the Masters. MacIntyre posted the   from the club on Twitter and wrote, ""Dreams do come true."" He gained some attention two weeks ago when Masters champion Dustin Johnson had to rally to halve their match in the Dell Match Play. Then, needing a birdie on the final hole against Adam Long to win his group, MacIntyre hit driver on the 371-yard closing hole so perfectly that it rolled up a bank and onto the green to 3 feet, the shot of the tournament. ""You've just got to keep fighting to the end,"" he said. Lee Westwood loves his game and his humor. They played one round in Scotland last year before MacIntyre had to withdraw. They didn't play again until The Players Championship last month. ""He didn't make a birdie in Scotland. He didn't make a birdie the first nine holes here,"" Westwood said. ""He birdied 11 and he went, ‘That’s the first birdie I've ever made playing with you.' I like his game. He's aggressive. He putts so nicely. He's got a good future."" MacIntyre is the latest hope to restore some golfing glory to Scotland; while the Masters was his first goal, the Ryder Cup is very much on his radar. He grew up in a house overlooking the 12th tee at Glencruitten Golf Club, a James Braid course that plays as a par 62 and demands creativity. His father is the greenskeeper, and MacIntyre and his two older sisters would play a four-hole loop at the end of the day. There's no place he'd rather be than Oban. It is a town of about 8,500 that he described as ""punching about its weight,"" much like MacIntyre. ""Have you been to Loch Lomond?"" he said. ""Take the Loch Lomond road, and if you don't come off the road for two hours, you'll come to Oban."" That it could produce the highest-ranked Scottish golfer (No. 44) is not a surprise, least of all to the left-handed MacIntyre, a scrappy lad known to mix it up whether it's golf or shinty. ""There's few folk from a smaller town than I'm from, but you've just got to dream,"" he said. ""A lot of people will doubt you, try to put you down, tell you that you can't do things. If you work hard enough and smart enough with the right people around you, anything is possible in this game."" MacIntyre played one year at McNeese State in Louisiana, competing against the likes of Jon Rahm. He played the Walker Cup at Los Angeles Country Club, where he beat Cameron Champ in one match (6 and 4) and halved with him in another. And then he made his pro debut on the MENA Tour (Middle East and North Africa). He opened with a 78 and then set the course record at 64 in the final round to tie for third. The Masters will be his seventh straight week in this American adventure he's on. He got off to a rough start in the World Golf Championship in Florida, where he tied for 61st. MacIntyre spoke that week of having issues at home without elaborating, except to say it was no excuse. Turns out his grandfather, the shinty legend, had died the week before at age 89. His mother joined him in Austin, Texas, with a self-anointed job description as ""chief cook, bottle washer and laundry servant."" MacIntyre described her as someone who would do anything for anyone and ""she does it well."" ""She doesn't get the attention she deserves and she doesn't want it,"" he said. Proof of that is back home in Oban. The family decided years ago to take in foster children, particularly those who have been neglected or abused. That has shaped him as much as shinty. Even those full of fight have room for compassion. ""When the wee boy first arrived, my mom went to give him a cuddle and he backed up,"" MacIntyre said. ""It brings a tear to my eye thinking about it. Some of the kids arrive with nothing, and you see your mom work endlessly to let them play golf, football, teach them to swim, every life skill they need. ""They come with nothing and they go away with as much as we can give them,"" he said. ""I've matured a lot seeing that."""
https://www.foxnews.com//sports/us-soccer-mls-and-nwsl-to-test-concussion-substitutes,sports,"U.S. Soccer, Major League Soccer and the National Women's Soccer League are joining a trial program that will allow teams two additional substitutes for suspected concussions in each match. The International Football Association Board, which sets the rules for the game, approved the trial for concussion substitutes last December. It is expected to run through August 2022. U.S. Soccer is working with the top men's and women's leagues, as well as the United Soccer League and the National Independent Soccer Association, to implement the pilot program protocol across the sport in the United States. ""We do think it’s incredibly important for players and player safety, and it speaks to our role of being a leader in this area and prioritizing health and safety above really anything else that we do as a league,"" said Jeff Agoos, vice president of competition for MLS. Starting this season, teams can make two substitutions for suspected concussions. That's in addition to the five substitutions already allowed because of the coronavirus. Normally teams are allowed three total substitutions. Concussion substitutions can be made even if a player has returned to the field to play. If teams sub out a player because of concussion, the opposing team gets an additional sub — addressing competitive balance concerns. ""It was critical to come together as a sport with our professional leagues and proceed in this pilot program, prioritizing the well-being of our players above all,"" Dr. George Chiampas, U.S. Soccer's chief medical officer, said in a statement. ""We’ve worked hard to raise awareness of head injuries in soccer over the last several years, and this change should go a long way in protecting players suspected of suffering a concussion."" The concussion rule was in force during the SheBeleives Cup in February. FIFA is considering whether it will be used at the Tokyo Olympics this summer. The English Premier League has allowed use of concussion substitutes since early February. West Ham United’s Issa Diop became the first player subbed out because of a suspected concussion in an FA Cup match against Manchester United on Feb. 9. In MLS, Agoos there will be additional resources to determine is a concussion substitute is needed. ""If a player is injured, obviously the medical staff will be called on to the field for an evaluation,"" Agoos told The Associated Press. ""If it’s a head injury, the venue medical director may come on and evaluate the player. In parallel, we have an independent group of people (spotters), similar to some of the other sports, that are reviewing the video of that play and then can send that video to the fourth official’s table where the venue medical director, the VMD, is located for further evaluation."" Additionally, different cards will be used by officials during MLS matches to indicate the kind of substitution being made: White for a normal sub, pink for a concussion sub and blue for an additional sub. MLS opens its regular season on April 16; the NWSL's preseason Challenge Cup tournament starts Friday."
https://www.foxnews.com//sports/nfl-colt-mccoy-eyes-of-texas-alumni-pressure-song,sports,"Veteran NFL quarterback Colt McCoy was reportedly a part of an alumni-charged effort to persuade the   to keep its spirit song ""Eyes of Texas"" amid pushback over alleged racist ties. McCoy, along with former NFL player Jordan Shipley and several other powerful alumni, was a part of emails discussing the backlash against the song in June, the   reported, citing emails the publication obtained. McCoy was reportedly on a conference call with energy entrepreneur Bud Brigham and other alums to talk about the song and come up with other ideas to remedy the situation. Scott Ingraham, another Texas alumnus, told those on the email chain the group should contact school president Jay Hartzell and athletic director Chris Del Conte and steer them away from making an immediate decision, according to the Texas Tribune. Ingraham also suggested that the school create a task force to review the song. ""A diverse group to illuminate the history and also the value of the song for ALL the stakeholders would be a healthy and beneficial process, as opposed to what is happening now with demands, or else,"" Brigham reportedly wrote to Hartzell on June 29. According to the newspaper, Brigham also wrote that the former Longhorns quarterback might suggest a task force to Del Conte. The committee was formed and a determination was made, but University of Texas at Austin spokesman J.B. Bird told the newspaper that the committee wasn’t formed due to alumni suggestions. McCoy did not comment on the story and the extent of his influence was not clear. He recently signed a one-year deal with the  . Hartzell declined to comment. On Monday, the Texas NAACP, along with Black Texas elected officials, some civil rights leaders, and Texas students and alumni held a press conference to announce their fight for the school to stop using the song, according to  . Critics of the song have said the ""Eyes of Texas"" has Confederacy ties. A 58-page report on the song was released by the university in March. A 24-person panel that convened to determine the meaning behind the song’s roots, lyrics and history   and striving toward excellence. The title of the song was reportedly taken from a favored saying of a former school president who had mimicked remarks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and was performed by musicians in blackface at minstrel shows. However, the panel could not find a direct link to the line ""the eyes of Texas are upon you"" and Lee. While alumni expressed issues with players not standing and participating in the playing of the song, Hartzell said in March that no student-athlete would be mandated to do so. ""Nobody has been, or will be, required to sing the song,"" Hartzell said. ""That's going to be going forward the way we continue to operate. We hope that as people go through the report, read through the facts, they'll find ways to participate in some way. Whether it's the case of the athletes standíng on the field, or the fans in the stands as we sing, there's going to be no punishment, no mandate, no requirement if people choose not to participate."""
https://www.foxnews.com//sports/players-hear-a-lot-of-talk-from-emmert-about-title-ix-nil,sports,"A trio of men's basketball players asked NCAA President Mark Emmert during a video call Thursday to abide by, and enforce, Title IX gender equity rules and to create a waiver that would let college athletes start earning money from use of their names, images and likenesses this year. What did the three students say they heard in return? ""A lot of talk,"" according to Iowa’s Jordan Bohannon. Another player involved, Rutgers’ Geo Baker, said Emmert repeatedly referred to waiting for Congress to intervene and summed up the session this way: ""What it really sounded like was that the NCAA doesn’t really want to be the first to make action."" ""We brought up a lot of our points, and it’s kind of like he would say the same thing and kind of agree with us. But that really wasn’t going anywhere,"" Michigan’s Isaiah Livers said. ""And obviously, from what I hear, he likes to kind of talk about points instead of make action."" Emmert's take: ""We had a really good, really constructive conversation,"" he said during an availability later Thursday, ""and I look forward to continuing to work with them and others."" In coordination with the National College Players Association, the athletes used a social media campaign — with the Twitter hashtag #NotNCAAProperty — during March Madness to protest rules that deny NIL rights and to put a spotlight on differences between the men's and women's basketball tournaments wrapping up this weekend in Indiana and Texas. ""Let this be the last NCAA tournament designed to treat women’s basketball players as inferior to men’s basketball players. Let this be the last NCAA tournament that generates a billion dollars from the talents of predominately black basketball players who aren’t allowed to make one dime off their own name,"" Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association, said on a call with reporters after the three players spoke with Emmert and, in a separate video meeting, Sens. Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal. ""This is why we’re all here today — to call for an end to the economic, racial and sex-based discrimination NCAA sports imposes on college athletes,"" Huma said. Title IX says schools that receive federal funding must provide equal opportunities to men and women. But even if the trio that met with Emmert knows the rules do not specifically apply to NCAA action, they think its principles should be followed by the group that oversees college sports, especially in light of  . ""It wasn’t a mistake. It was almost like it was clearly done that they didn’t want to put as much effort (into) the women’s that they did for the men’s,"" Bohannon said. ""So us requesting that is further hopefully understanding in the future that this situation will never happen again."" In addition to the Title IX and NIL topics, Emmert was asked to give players more of a voice in the process, including in front of the Division I Council and Board of Governors. Huma said miscommunication led to there not being any female athletes present for the video meeting with Emmert, who said: ""We need to do the same thing with women’s athletes, by the way. Obviously, I haven’t talked to any athletes on the women’s side but want to do that as soon as possible."" There were women's basketball players who spoke to the media along with Bohannon, Baker and Livers. They said they were upset about the much-discussed differences between the two basketball tournaments. They also wanted to look forward and make the case for how NIL rights can help college athletes. ""I’m here just because I’m not sure that anything will change by the time I leave here,"" Michigan junior forward Naz Hillmon said, ""but I hope to see some change."" The blanket waiver would permit players to seek NIL endorsement deals as soon as July, before any full action comes on Capitol Hill, where there is legislation pending. And Emmert's response on that? ""Basically he said he’s going to get back to us. There wasn’t a direct answer. That was one of the times where he kept talking about Congress, you know? Needing help from Congress. What can Congress do first?"" Baker said. ""And then he basically said, ‘Well, if Congress doesn’t do anything, then we can discuss the other possibilities, like a blanket waiver.’ Kind of going around the question a little bit, basically just saying he’ll get back to us about it."""

With a large share of the nation’s workforce continuing to work remotely, many used their downtime last year to fulfill their dream of   far from plague-ridden urban centers. Data from Realtor.com shows that sales of homes built more than 100 years ago rose by 16% in 2020 in the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) compared to last year, with a median sale price of $236,000. During the same period, New York City saw a sales decline of 6% overall. ""The biggest ask right now is ‘something old with character’ — newer homes have none of the richness or the stories of something built in 1814,"" New York-based Compass agent Adam Carroll told The Post. Viral social media accounts like Elizabeth and Ethan Finkelstein’s   feed on Instagram — which spotlights dilapidated properties for sale for less than $100,000 and boasts 1.5 million followers — fanned the flames, galvanizing real estate markets in historic areas across the country. But while ""cheap old house"" buyers may see ""good bones"" when they pick up a stunning Queen Anne or a cool Craftsman bungalow, experts warn that restoring these money pits to their former glory requires serious know-how and a fat checking account. Four months ago, attorney Stephen Simcock, 58, found out firsthand. He purchased a 170-year-old waterfront fixer-upper in the Hudson Valley when the pandemic changed his work/life balance. He declined to reveal the exact cost of his new retreat, but he paid more than three times the area’s median listing price of $775,000, according to Realtor.com. ""I might have legal title, but I’m joining its story,"" said Simcock of the Greek Revival property in the hamlet of Barrytown, New York. A 4,200-square-foot former ice store, complete with the ghost foundations of demolished storage houses dotted across its 1½-acre grounds, the four-bedroom home boasts a torrid history. ""In its various iterations, this house has been a store, definitely a hotel, maybe a brothel, a halfway house, a college dorm and then a single-family house,"" he paused, laughing, ""I like to think I bring a little of all of that."" Simcock said he knew what he was getting into when he bought the house. For instance, he knew that he would add bathrooms, open up the kitchen and replace the small, heat-conserving windows, typical of their time, with large frames to maximize his water views. ""The goal is for it to become a really beautiful country house, having accreted so much charm over the years, but with more creature comforts,"" he said. All of those elements came with costly challenges. But it was the antique beadboard (vertically grooved wall panels) that caught him by surprise. The decorative wood molding, which runs down his stairway, had been stripped from most of the walls. Simply identifying the specific style of board has been a challenge; finding matching replacements has been a head-scratcher. Hunting down matches for rare newel posts and spindles (the decoratively turned supports on a staircase or railing) was also difficult. ""I’m a dilettante, but I’m doing it with as much rigor as I can."" Simcock said. ""I’m poring over books of architecture and design to find the perfect, perfectly authentic pieces."""

The controversial   were a collaboration with the 21-year-old rapper, which MSCHF and Lil Nas X promoted on Monday, March 29, via  . MSCHF modified the shoes with prints that read ""1/666"" and ""Luke 10:18"" along with a gold pentagram and a liquid-swishing sole that reportedly contains a single drop of human blood. The company quickly sold out of the 666 pairs it made for $1,018 each. Nike filed a four-part complaint against MSCHF on Monday, including trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition, trademark dilution and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition. Lil Nas X is not named a defendant in the lawsuit, according to documents uploaded by  . In a statement sent to Fox News on Thursday, MSCHF asserted the Satan Shoes were created as an artistic commentary much like the holy water-filled Jesus Shoes it debuted in 2019. ""Over a year ago we released the Jesus Shoes. As a manifested speculative artwork Jesus Shoes conflates celebrity collab culture and brand worship with religious worship into a limited edition line of art objects,"" MSCHF’s statement reads. ""Last week’s release of the Satan Shoes, in collaboration with Lil Nas X, was no different. Satan Shoes started a conversation, while also living natively in its space. It is art created for people to observe, speculate on, purchase, and own. Heresy only exists in relation to doctrine: who is Nike to censor one but not the other?"" Lawyers for Nike reportedly argued that MSCHF’s Satan Shoes are damaging to the sneaker giants brand and have caused confusion among customers who believe it is an original Nike creation, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, a lawyer for MSCHF   on Wednesday that opposed Nike’s application for a temporary restraining order. The art collective argues that it made it clear the Satan Shoes were a collaboration with Lil Nas X and not with Nike, according to defense attorney Megan K. Kannigan. ""There is not imminent or immediate threat of irreparable harm related to the Satan Shoes,"" the letter reads before explaining, ""all but one pair of the shoes already have been sold and shipped."" The final shoe was being held for a giveaway but MSCHF is reportedly holding off due to the current litigation. MSCHF will not be producing additional Satan Shoes, the letter explains. Representatives for Lil Nas X and Nike did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment. The release of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes coincide with Lil Nas X’s music video ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name),"" which debuted Friday and shows the rapper dancing with the devil and taking his crown. In an explanation video Lil Nas X provided to  , the young artist said ""Montero"" is partly about his attraction to a man and the dark temptations that are in Hollywood.

It sold for $213,000.   Currently, records indicate that Shah and her husband are renting an approximately $8,000/month Park City space — which sorta resembles a mini-me of her TV home — that they moved into shortly after selling their 16-year home.  Shah and her   assistant Stuart Smith, 43, were arrested by the feds on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison.  ""Shah and Smith flaunted their lavish lifestyle to the public as a symbol of their ‘success,’"" said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Peter Fitzhugh in a statement. ""In reality, they allegedly built their opulent lifestyle at the expense of vulnerable, often elderly, working-class people."" The indictment out of the Southern District of New York claims Shah and Smith executed a telemarketing scheme with co-conspirators that operated in five states — New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. A rep for Shah declined to comment on her arrest. According to the indictment, hundreds of victims, many of whom were over 55, were tricked into investing in shady projects and business services which included coaching sessions, tax preparation and website design services.  What’s worse, many of the individuals targeted did not own a computer.  The alleged scheme took place from 2012 up until as recently as this month.  ""At no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment, nor did the victims actually earn any such returns,"" the indictment states. Her on-set debacle is a far cry from January, when Shah  , announcing she was launching a program dubbed ""Social Commerce,"" to assist women in need amid the  . ""We’re helping women pivot and shift their business through the quarantine and COVID,"" she explained at the time. ""To helping them still stabilize their business through online sales because their brick and mortar stores are closed… We’ve been working with some ladies, so you’ll see some of that coming out and hearing their stories and seeing how we help their businesses grow.""

In Monday’s White House coronavirus briefing, Walensky also noted a 3% increase in hospital admissions, averaging about 4,970. While she noted a decrease of daily deaths, about 800 total per day, she expressed concern that younger demographics are behind the spikes in cases and hospitalizations. ""As the trends in data have been indicating, cases are increasing nationally and we are seeing this occur predominately in younger adults,"" Walensky said. ""This is why you’ve heard me so clearly share my concern. We know that these increases are due in part to more highly transmissible variants which we are very closely monitoring.

https://www.foxnews.com//health/why-can-chronic-stress-result-in-hair-loss-new-research-provides-clues,lifestyle,"It’s well known that chronic stress can lead to  , but how exactly stress causes hair loss has been a mystery — until now. A new study conducted by researchers at Harvard University may provide a clue.  In a study recently published in the journal  , researchers determined that a stress hormone keeps hair follicle stem cells in an ""extended resting phase,"" meaning the growth of new hair is put on hold for a longer amount of time than normal.  First, it’s important to understand the three stages of hair growth: growth, rest and degeneration. In the first state, hair follicle cells are activated and hair is continually produced, in the second, the hair stays in a state of rest but can still shed, and in the last stage — degeneration — hair falls out.  ""During the resting phase, the stem cells are quiescent and hairs shed more easily. Hair loss can occur if the hairs shed and the stem cells remain quiescent without regenerating new tissue,""   on the study’s findings.  The researchers specifically looked at the adrenal glands, which produce a stress hormone called corticosterone, and the connection to hair loss in mice. (Corticosterone in mice is thought to be the equivalent of the stress hormone cortisol that is produced in humans.)  The researchers surgically removed adrenal glands from the mice in the study. Later, they found that the hair follicles in the mice with the removed adrenal glands had a shorter resting phase but entered the growth phase more often. When they administered corticosterone to the mice, their hair growth was slowed to normal.  Over nine weeks, the researchers also administered corticosterone to mice whose adrenal glands were still intact. They observed that these mice had elevated corticosterone levels as well as reduced hair growth, finding that their hair follicles stayed in a rest phase for a longer amount of time than normal.  ""The real surprise came when we depleted stress hormones. Under normal conditions, hair follicle regeneration slows over time – the resting phase becomes longer as the animals age. But when we removed the stress hormones under unstressed normal conditions, the stem cells’ resting phase became extremely short and the mice constantly entered the growth phase to regenerate new hair follicles and hairs throughout their life, even when they were old,"" said Ya-Chieh Hsu, the Alvin and Esta Star Associate Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at Harvard and senior author of the study, to  The researchers shaved the mice whose adrenal glands were removed. Nineteen days later, they had a fully regrown coat, while the mice who did not have their adrenal glands removed and were also shaved were still mostly bald.  ""So even the baseline level of stress hormone that’s normally circulating in the body is an important regulator of the resting phase. Stress essentially just elevates this preexisting ‘adrenal gland–hair follicle axis,’ making it even more difficult for hair follicle stem cells to enter the growth phase to regenerate new hair follicles,"" Hsu explained in the accompanying press release on the study’s findings.  Once the link between the stress hormone and hair follicle stem cell activity was noted, the researchers then explored the biological mechanism behind the connection. ""We first asked whether the stress hormone was regulating the stem cells directly and checked by taking out the receptor for corticosterone, but this turned out to be wrong. Instead, we found that the stress hormone actually acts on a cluster of dermal cells underneath the hair follicle, known as the dermal papilla,"" Sekyu Choi, another study leader, said in a statement.  ""Dermal papilla is known to be critical for activating hair follicle stem cells, but none of the previously identified factors secreted from dermal papilla changed when stress hormone levels were altered. Rather, the stress hormone prevented dermal papilla cells from secreting Gas6, a molecule that the researchers showed can activate the hair follicle stem cells,"" reads the release.  Though more research is needed, the study authors are hopeful that certain gene therapies could be possibly used in the future to combat hair loss in humans.  ""Under both normal and stress conditions, adding Gas6 was sufficient to activate hair follicle stem cells that were in the resting phase and to promote hair growth,"" Choi said. ""In the future, the Gas6 pathway could be exploited for its potential in activating stem cells to promote hair growth. It will also be very interesting to explore if other stress-related tissue changes are related to the stress hormone’s impact on regulating Gas6."" ""When looking for factors that control stem cell behaviors, normally we would look locally in the skin. While there are important local factors, our findings suggest that the major switch for hair follicle stem cell activity is actually far away in the adrenal gland and it works by changing the threshold required for stem cell activation,"" Hsu added.  ""You can have systemic control of stem cell behavior located in a different organ that plays a really important role, and we are learning more and more examples of these ‘cross-organ interactions.’ Tissue biology is interconnected with body physiology. We still have so much to learn in this area, but we are constantly reminded by our findings that in order to understand stem cells in the skin, we often need to think beyond the skin."""

Results stemmed from the multi-case control study   and validated questionnaires sent to nearly 8,000 adults, half of whom had diagnoses for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, and the other half serving as the control group, without cancer diagnoses.

The fashion brand from Fujian, China can also keep the favorite frock cheap by offering it in five sizes, and lure brides in a hurry with speedy Prime shipping.   ""They don’t have to cut as many sizes because the fabric has some stretch to it,"" Valerie Cooper, chief executive of apparel production firm Heart-Hunters Consulting, said of the sizing, the Post reports. By doing away with traditional tricks like ""boning"" and ""corseting,"" the style is more size-inclusive by design, too. One Amazon shopper said the dress was a dream come true for her coronavirus elopement nuptials, and revealed she planned to rock it again at her larger reception in the future. ""I had bought three other expensive dresses for when we were planning a big wedding, and I had actually chosen this one as a reception dress. Before we canceled the big wedding, I was seriously considering this as my main ceremony dress because I loved it that much,"" the bride  ""I will STILL wear this as my reception dress when we have that. This was my dream dress, and I still can’t believe my dream dress was less than $40. Would recommend to anyone, whether on a budget or not."""

""I was training, working out with guys just hoping for a shot ... This year I was actually able to get into the Pro Day because they had it."" Erdmann was eligible for the   last year but he said coming from an NCAA Divison III school meant that he would need to play in front of teams to make an impression -- without a platform to showcase his skills, he wasn’t picked up.  ""For me especially, my feedback as a D-III quarterback coming out of school, it was like ‘okay, he’s got good film. He’s got good stats and everything but we just have to see him in person, being D-III seeing if he looks like he does on tape’ … that’s why the Pro Day was so big for me last year.""  He continued: ""I was really disappointed last year when it ended up being canceled. I was supposed to be throwing Tyler Johnson (  wideout) and a couple of other guys, so that was disappointing for sure."" Erdmann was redshirted his first year at   where he was a preferred walk-on before deciding to transfer to SJU, which would ultimately give him the opportunity to play as well as he did.  ""Traditionally [Penn State’s] been pro-style offense and they actually made a switch on offensive coordinator when I was there and they were kind of molding the offense around Saquan (Barkley) and moving into a dual-threat offense with Trace McSorley and Tommy Stevens … and [I thought] this doesn’t fit my strength and abilities as much and I can’t showcase myself.""  Erdmann earned a number of awards as the Johnnies starter and was named the 2018 Gagliardi Trophy recipient as the NCAA Division III's most outstanding player -- the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy for D1 athletes. In his senior year alone, he threw for 5,040 passing yards and 47 touchdowns.  Despite the setback, he would join the Fan Controlled Football league in 2021, where he would win the championship game as the Wild Aces signal-caller in the league’s inaugural season.  Erdman was back on track with Thursday’s appearance and he certainly caught the attention of several scouts. ""I spoke to a couple,"" he recalled. ""I was throwing pretty much the whole time … but a couple came up to me and were like ‘Hey, I remember you … you looked good. You’ve developed a lot over this last year."" Erdman said that he spoke to Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck who told him that several team representatives came up to him asking: ""Who the heck is this guy, where did he come from?"" ""It was great hearing the scouts’ feedback yesterday like, ‘Hey, you’ve developed well,’"" Erdmann added.

https://www.foxnews.com//sports/pushing-for-change-college-athletes-voices-grow-strong,sports,"Their protests are not centered on a controversial war in some far off jungle but on issues of racial and social inequity at home. Their pulpit is not a segregated lunch counter, a music festival in upstate New York or Freedom Rides through the South but the seemingly boundless power of social media. The voices of thousands of college athletes are being heard louder and clearer than they have in years and it is the most politically and socially active generation in a half-century, since the turbulent years of the late 1960s and early ‘70s. From seemingly small issues of inequality in NCAA Tournament weight rooms to life-and-death issues of police brutality and endemic racism, athletes are increasingly calling for change, intent on molding what the future should look like for everyone. ""Some of the things that have occurred this past year, it's encouraged a lot of us to speak out on things, social justice, and how we feel,"" said Loyola Chicago's Lucas Williamson, who is working on a film project involving the school's 1963 national title team that broke down racial barriers. ""The things we've seen, going back to last summer, it's been emotional for me,"" Williamson said, ""and it's given me the confidence to go out there and speak on some things I feel confident about, and some things that I feel are just causes."" While the movement gained momentum last summer, when   and   died at the hands of police and protests hit America's streets, the reality is that social unrest has been bubbling out of sight for years. It took   to bring it to the surface. The NFL quarterback's polarizing stance against social and racial injustice in 2016 was embraced by other pro athletes, and that in turn encouraged college athletes to take a stand. They joined the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse, and began threatening to strike — to walk off the field of play — unless their demands were heard and met. Protests by more than   against on-campus racism led to he ouster of the president of the university system and the chancellor of its flagship campus. And despite pushback from legislators that threatened to strip funding for scholarships, they found support from athletes on campuses across the country. The movement had gone mainstream. The momentum had become unstoppable. According to Andrew M. Linder, a professor of sociology at Skidmore College, there are two main reasons for this athlete-fueled focus on change: First, younger people in general are more progressive on such issues as race, gender and injustice than previous cohorts at the same age, and second, they have been emboldened by their athletic heroes. ""Many of the current group of college players may have grown up being inspired by not just their on-court play but also their dedication to speaking out,"" Linder said. ""Consider a college freshman that was about 12 years old when   in solidarity with protests of Eric Garner's death. Sports heroes' words and deeds matter."" James has 49.5 million followers on Twitter. His reach is almost unending. Yet even college athletes whose voices in the past might have been drowned out are being heard.

""We are in a new generation,"" said N'Dea Jones, a standout on the Texas A&M women's team. ""People have been afraid to speak up, especially concerning blackballing or the consequences of speaking up against the NCAA. But from what everybody has been through this year with racial injustices, inequality, and COVID, people have found in themselves that they need to speak up.""

It's amazing they can and are willing to put themselves out there, to institute change and demand what's right."" Many of them are doing so at significant risk.

""I would only add that college athletes, particularly those in the revenue sports, have also started to realize they have real power,"" Hawkins said. There are plenty of college athletes these days that are willing to put in real work on off-court issues like racial, social and economic injustice. ""It has to be stopped. It has to be addressed.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker, 12-time Pro Bowler and two-time Super Bowl champion is teaming up with the Professional Fighters League (PFL) in a new role aimed at advancing the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). ""There’s not a lot of options – only 1% make it in the National Football League, the NBA and so on – but when you have these people with these types of skills, I have an eye for that. I have an eye for people who have the will but don’t have the opportunity, people who have the skills but not the right platform,"" Lewis told Fox News in a recent interview. ""So, from a leadership side, it’s like me coming in giving all the motivation I’ve been given for years and empowering people to succeed."" Lewis joins MMA legend Randy Couture as the second member of the Athlete Advisory Board, which will be comprised of MMA champions, sports icons and experts in the medical field. Additional announcements are expected in the coming months. ""Ray is a champion, a true athlete and leader. Ray started his athletic journey as a wrestler, and MMA inspires him and so it’s a great fit,"" Peter Murray, PFL CEO said. ""He’s so passionate about the sport of MMA, its growth and ultimately the PFL’s vision."" As a member of the advisory board, Lewis, who spent his entire 17-year NFL career with the   and was one of the league’s top defensive players of all-time, will identify new talent and help drive the fighter-first culture of the PFL. ""Every day you have to have an edge, every day you have to be motivating yourself in life to lead. If you can get more people in these sports, as opposed to doing other things, then we win,"" Lewis said. ""That’s where I think me working with Randy Couture will be really exciting because it's combining our skills and life experiences."" Since its debut in 2018, the PFL has been a rising star on the MMA stage. Unlike the UFC, which features a handful of fights during each event, including preliminary bouts, the main card and a marquee fight usually for a title – the PFL operates much more like an NFL season would. ""It's a format built on meritocracy that works for every major athlete from the NFL to the NBA,"" Murray said. ""Fighters win to advance, those who lose go home. There is a regular season, a playoff and a championship."" The playoff-style format and the chance for the best athletes to advance and earn the million-dollar championship prize are what really drew Lewis to the PFL. ""The format is way better than what the MMA gives us right now. I just love that you have this real avenue to be successful – they want the same thing any NFL player wants. They want chances to be noticed, to go against top people in the business and make some good money,"" Lewis said. In just a few years since its first season, the PFL has already 25% of the audience of the UFC, according to  . ""What’s driving that success is a couple of factors – there's an underserved fan base of 550 million fans around the world, 80% of those fans are outside the U.S., 20% in the U.S.,"" Murray said. ""It is the youngest fan base of all major sports and half of this overall fan base they're not watching stick and ball sports, they want access to more premium quality MMA and the PFL delivers that."" Murray added that the PFL format provides another layer of success, being easy to follow with great narratives and big stars. ""With our sports season format, it’s actually complimentary to the UFC. It is distributed on ESPN on a different night of the week for those avid MMA fans as well as the casual fans,"" Murray added.    is still the heavy hitter, being valued at $7 billion, according to president Dana White, and highlights some of the biggest names in the sport like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey. But with new sponsorships lined up, initiatives to expand its global reach, and new stars like Anthony Pettis and Kayla Harrison, the PFL is excited about its future. ""From Anheuser-Busch InBev, Geico to the armed forces are our current sponsors and we’ve partnered with IBM and many other major brands,"" Murray said, adding that there will be some major announcements ahead of the 2021 season from ""brands in some of the top spending categories in sports who have never sponsored MMA properties or events before."" The PFL opted to cancel its 2020 season due to COVID concerns, but Murray expects a strong bounce back from all the ""pent-up excitement"" when the fighters make their 2021 season debut on ESPN on April 23. ""The playoff-style brings different energy around it. A lot of people won’t just sit there and watch MMA if they don’t know about it, but if you give somebody a playoff-style anybody sits down and watches that because there’s intrigue who carries on and who moves to the next round,"" Lewis added"

Adesanya apologized for the remark after facing Robertson’s condemnation. ""Last weekend fight talk escalated to a point in which I crossed the line,"" he wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. ""I understand the gravity of this word and how it can affect and hurt other people apart from my opponent, although that was NEVER my intention. I am still growing under the spotlight, and I take this as a lesson to be more selective with words under pressure."" MMA Junkie also noted that Adesanya has a history of controversial statements. The UFC 4 cover star said in February 2020 that Yoel Romero was going to ""crumble like the Twin Towers."" He also apologized for that and said he would be ""more careful"" with his future words."

Miocic got back up and hit Ngannou and thought he had the advantage in the moment but opened himself up for more damage from the Cameroon native. Ngannou landed a nasty hook and caught Miocic by surprise and stayed on top of him for the win. It was a complete 180 from their first match at UFC 220 in 2018 when the fight went the full five rounds. Ngannou lost that match via unanimous decision and came all the way back more than three years later to get his revenge to become the 17th undisputed heavyweight champion in UFC history. After the 2018 loss to Miocic, he would lose again that year to Derrick Lewis. Ngannou needed wins against Curtis Blaydes, Cain Velasquez, Junior dos Santos and Jarizinho Rozenstruik to even get a shot at the heavyweight title again. Who’s next for ""The Predator""? UFC legend Daniel Cormier, who was on the ESPN broadcast, floated the idea of a fight between Ngannou and Jon Jones. ""Bones"" last fought in February 2020.

What’s next for Ngannou? A possible date in the octagon with UFC great Jon Jones. Ngannou, who is on a five-fight winning streak, addressed what could be one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport during his post-fight press conference. He said that it ""makes the most sense for me."" ""In my opinion, Jon Jones is the greatest of all time in mixed martial arts,"" Ngannou said via  . ""Him moving up is going to be a challenge I will take. It'll be a very good challenge. ... But this time I am the champ, he is coming up and looking for me. I am ready any time soon."" Jones, who last fought in February of 2020, will need to make his debut as a heavyweight in order to fight Ngannou, after spending all of his career in the light heavyweight division. After Ngannou pulled out the incredible knockout win over Miocic, Jones took his thoughts to Twitter, addressing the rumors that he may meet ""The Predator"" in the octagon next. Jones initially tweeted, ""Let's play baby"" after the fight. But he immediately deleted it and replaced it by saying, ""Show me the money."" After UFC president Dana White said Derrick Lewis would be a possible contender to face Ngannou next, he added that the ball is in Jones’ court if he wants to fight him. White said earlier this year that Jones will take on the winner of the Miocic-Ngannou fight. ""If I'm Jon Jones and I'm home watching this fight, I start thinking of moving to [middleweight],"" White said when hearing of Jones' tweet. ""What's 'show me the money' mean? You can say you want to fight somebody – but do you really want to?"" Jones fired back at White on Twitter after hearing what he had to say. ""I quit the light heavyweight division, literally gained a massive amount of weight. And now people are saying I'm afraid?"" Jones tweeted. ""Everyone but me claiming that I'm afraid.

Cody Stashak, Hansel Robles and Jorge Alcala combined for four innings of one-hit relief. The only hit the bullpen allowed came on Jackie Bradley Jr.'s sixth-inning homer off Stashak. Garver broke a 1-all tie and put the Twins ahead for good   off Brewers starter Adrian Houser (0-1) with one out in the fifth. Pineda got out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom half of the fifth by striking out Avisaíl García. Minnesota broke the game open in the sixth with four runs off reliever Drew Rasmussen. Kepler hit a two-run single and Sanó followed with a  The Twins benefited that inning from an error by first baseman Keston Hiura, whose high throw to second on a fielder’s choice pulled shortstop Luis Urías off the bag. Hiura is a converted second baseman who had never played first base before this season. He switched positions to make room for Kolten Wong, a two-time Gold Glove second baseman who signed with the Brewers in February. One encouraging sign for the Brewers was the way Houser performed as he attempts to bounce back from a 2020 season in which he went 1-6 with a 5.30 ERA. Houser struck out four while allowing two runs, four hits and two walks in five innings.

Yuli Gurriel had three hits and two RBIs. Houston outscored the A’s 35-9 in the series with 47 hits, including eight home runs. The Astros became the fourth team in major league history to score eight or more runs in each of its first four games. ""We just had tons of momentum coming in from last year,"" McCormick said. ""The guys are really hungry. We just crushed them from the first pitch to the last pitch of the whole series. It was cool to watch, cool to be a part of."" Sweeping the division rival A’s was especially pleasing to the Astros, who were taunted at the Coliseum throughout the series. Houston faces the fallout from the sign-stealing scandal in which Major League Baseball penalized the team ahead of the 2020 season, which was played in empty ballparks due to the pandemic. Oakland won seven of the 10 games with Houston in 2020 on the way to its first AL West title since 2013. ""You can’t do much better than the start that we had,"" Baker said.

Third on the franchise’s list for games caught entering the year, the 33-year-old Castro is slated for a backup role this season and is likely to share time with Martín Maldonado. Castro’s home run off Sean Manaea (0-1) in the second came after Myles Straw drew a two-out walk. Tucker homered off Manaea in the first. McCormick added a three-run drive off Yusmeiro Petit in the sixth, his first in the majors. ""It was unreal,"" McCormick said. ""It was an 0-2 count. Rounding the bases I couldn’t stop smiling.""

Astros: OF Michael Brantley showed improvement a day after getting hit in the right wrist by a 90 mph fastball, and Baker is cautiously optimistic.

No such moves will be possible in their attempt to repeat. ""We have zero dollars of cap space to acquire a player between now and the trade deadline,"" general manager Julien BriseBois said. ""Literally zero dollars. That’s the obstacle."" That obstacle isn't unique to the defending champions going into a trade deadline like none other in league history. Eighteen of 31 teams have $1 million or less of salary cap space and the cap ceiling won't go up a penny next season, so things are tighter than ever. Prominent players like Buffalo's Taylor Hall and goaltenders Jonathan Bernier and Devan Dubnyk seem likely to move, but even hockey's most seasoned executives aren't sure what to expect before the clock strikes 3 p.m. Eastern on April 12. ""There’s so much unknown because of the cap,"" New York Islanders GM Lou Lamoriello said. ""The cap is going to be flat next year. So any contract that you take on that is more than one year is going to disrupt whatever you’re doing next year and will put you in worse shape. So that complicates the matter without the cap increases, but it’s the same for everyone."" The seven Canadian teams are in a ""tougher spot,"" Toronto GM Kyle Dubas acknowledged, because of a weeklong mandatory quarantine for any player acquired from the U.S. That's half the quarantine imposed earlier this season but still makes it more difficult to swallow paying a hefty price for a player who might be available for only 10 regular-season games before the playoffs begin. And that's if teams can agree to a trade with so little cap room. Tampa Bay, Washington, Vegas and Montreal don't have the space to add even a player making the league minimum, according to   calculations, and several others would need to clear room to add anyone with even a modest salary. ""A lot of teams are in the same situation we’re in where they literally have no cap space or very, very little — not enough to add a player without subtracting,"" BriseBois said. ""The teams that are kind of on the bubble, I don’t know how what’s ultimately going to guide their decisions. Are they going to try to add? Are they going to sell? Will there be more teams just standing pat? I don’t know, but it’s going to be interesting to find out."" Philadelphia and Columbus are among those on the playoff bubble with tradeable assets.   have lost three of five since GM Chuck Fletcher said they're ""not looking at selling right now."" That can obviously change. The buyers are easier to identify: Lamoriello's Islanders  , Dubas' Maple Leafs look like the class of the North Division with perhaps a hole or two to fill and Edmonton might be a top-four defenseman away from challenging Toronto. ""If you’re talking about trying to go out and get a legit top-four — any, a lefty or a righty — defenseman, No. 1 there’s not a lot of them that are going to be available,"" Oilers GM Ken Holland said. ""And those that are going to be available, the price is going to be high."" A couple of top defensemen could also stay put if Nashville remains in playoff contention and keeps Ryan Ellis and Mattias Ekholm. Right-shooting Blue Jackets defenseman David Savard is a pending free agent and arguably the most sought-after player on the market. Hall and New Jersey's Kyle Palmieri fit the Islanders' need without Lee, though they aren't the only team looking for that kind of player. ""We’re always trying to find a scoring winger,"" Lamoriello said. ""Everybody is. That’s not something that’s easy to do."" It's also not easy to find a reliable goaltender, which Colorado and Washington would love to add as playoff insurance in win-now mode. Maybe that's Bernier or Carolina's James Reimer, who are currently injured, or a bigger swing at someone like Jonathan Quick of Los Angeles. Players like Quick or Anaheim forward Rickard Rakell would normally be important additions this time of year because they're signed beyond this season. That was Tampa Bay's thinking getting Coleman and Goodrow for at least two playoff runs, but the salary cap remaining flat at $81.5 million changes the equation. ""Usually you’d put a premium on getting a player that has future years,"" Dubas said. ""It’s a little bit more complex this year knowing that very likely it’s going to be at 81.5 again, the cap, so anything that we take from next year’s allotment, it impacts a number of different things as you can well imagine. It’s a rare time where probably a rental is a better fit."" Even acquiring a pending free agent isn't simple for the league's top contenders. Washington's Brian MacLellan would have to trade from his roster to get a veteran goalie or upgrade elsewhere, and colleagues who are in sellers can make the Capitals or another team pay for unloading salary. ""There’s teams who do have cap space that are willing to take on space, so if you want to buy cap space, that’s available,"" said Montreal GM Marc Bergevin, who needed the Sabres to retain half of Eric Staal's salary to get him in a trade for two draft picks. ""But there’s a price to pay for that, and depending on the amount you’re trying to buy, then the price becomes steeper."" All of that adds up to an uncertain trade deadline where no one's quite sure how much movement there will be. ""Your guess is as good as mine,"" BriseBois said."

Stanford defeated Arizona, 54-53, to win its first women’s basketball championship since 1992. It was the team’s third title and third under coach Tara VanDerveer. Woods, a Stanford alumnus, tweeted his congratulatory message as he recovers from injuries sustained in a horrific car crash in February. ""Congratulations to the entire @StanfordWBB team and to Coach VanDerveer. What a win. Home of Champions! Go Card!"" he wrote. Woods attended Stanford in 1994 after the Cardinal had won the NCAA championship. He would defend his U.S. Amateur title in 1995 and get named the Pac-10 Player of the Year, selected as an NCAA First-Team All-American. In 1996, he was the first golfer to win three straight U.S. Amateur titles and won the NCAA individual golf championship. Woods has been recovering from the leg injuries suffered in an accident while driving his SUV in California. The Los Angeles County sheriff said a cause for the crash has been determined but the report won’t be released, citing privacy concerns. ""A cause has been determined, the investigation has concluded,"" LA Sheriff Alex Villanueva said last week. He added that investigators need permission from Woods to release the information. ""We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel,"" Villanueva continued.

https://www.foxnews.com//sports/gonzagas-last-hurdles-a-quick-turnaround-and-baylor,sports,"Now comes the hard part for Gonzaga. Less than 16 hours after walking off the floor with one of the most scintillating wins in the game's history, the barely-still-undefeated Bulldogs returned to the practice court Sunday to get ready for the national championship game. Their opponent, Baylor, is rested, ready and waiting for a challenge. The meeting Monday is one most hoops fans have waited for all year — two years, really — a matchup between two teams who have been on a collision course since the bracket came out. No need for extra motivation here. But how do the Zags move on after THAT? ""It's a lot in 30 hours, but it is what it is,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""My guys have been great at game preparations all season, so consistent with effort and the attention to detail on game night. So, we're definitely banking on that."" To recap,   from a step inside the midcourt line at the buzzer to lift the Zags to a 93-90 overtime victory over UCLA. The game ended after 11 p.m. Saturday. By the time that happened, Baylor (27-2) was back at the hotel. ""We were probably like everyone else on the eighth floor of the hotel,"" Baylor coach Scott Drew said of the reaction to The Shot. ""Pandemonium erupted."" The Bears rolled over Houston 78-59 and, suddenly, they look every bit as unbeatable as the unbeaten Bulldogs (31-0). No team has come closer than nine points of Baylor over the three weeks in Indianapolis. This matchup has been a long time in the making. Had the COVID-19 pandemic not washed out the 2020 postseason, both these teams would have been No. 1 seeds in last season's NCAA Tournament. They were supposed to play this season, too. The meeting was set for Dec. 5 in Indianapolis — a Final Four preview in the Final Four city, many predicted — but the game got scratched when a Zags player and a staffer tested positive. The coaches worked hard to try to reschedule. But there was no room on the calendar. Instead, they meet for the title. This marks the first time since 2005 that the top two teams on the overall seeding list have faced in the final. Gonzaga has spent the entire season at No. 1 in the AP poll. Baylor spent 15 of 17 weeks at No. 2 and finished at No. 3 (behind Illinois). Nobody will ever forget Adam Morrison's tears against UCLA. Now, nobody will forget his ""Yeessssss."" The former Gonzaga star was crestfallen,   in the hardwood after a devastating loss to the Bruins in the Sweet 16 back in 2006. Fifteen years, later, he does color for Bulldogs radio, and his   was getting plenty of buzz a day later. It's three loud shouts of ""Yesssss"" with some other hooting and hollering to wrap it up. Few said the team's sports information director played it for him on the way over to do his interviews Sunday. ""A pretty special moment, and I was happy for him and proud of him for letting his guard down,"" the coach said. Before COVID put a three-week hold on their season in February, the Bears were undefeated, too. After starting 18-0, they lost two of six shortly after coming out of the break. Drew said the lack of quality practice time during the layoff, then afterward when Baylor was playing almost every other day, took its toll on the team's defense. Only when the Bears lost to Oklahoma State in the Big 12 tournament semifinals were they able to get back to practicing regularly, and get back to basics. ""Our players really bought in,"" Drew said. ""Our defense was lapsing, and we had to get back to where we were."" Analytics rank the Bears third in the nation in forced turnovers and sixth in steals — part of the formula for stopping Gonzaga’s top-ranked offense. Baylor's Davion Mitchell's nickname is ""Off Night,"" because anyone he D's up on seems to have one. His next task: Stopping Suggs. In addition to making the shot of the tournament, Suggs is averaging 14 points and 5.5 rebounds a game and setting himself up as an NBA lottery pick should he decide to leave. Mitchell says he knows he can't shut down anyone completely. ""My job is just to slow ‘em down, not to keep ’em from scoring,"" Mitchell said. ""Everyone's really good at this game. My job is just to limit that."" Few and Drew are fishing buddies in the offseason, and pickleball partners in the basketball bubble. Conceding that it might be a break in COVID-19 protocols, Few said he and the Baylor coach haven't lost a game on the pickleball courts set up at the baseball stadium where teams have gone for fresh air during their semi-quarantined stay in Indianapolis. The coaches' time together during the tournament has offered them a chance to reflect on their journeys. Few has been head coach at Gonzaga since 1999 and helped build the tiny school into a powerhouse. Drew took over a Baylor program   by a teammate. ""We've talked about where we were and where we are,"" Few said. ""Our path was a lot smoother and didn't come from a dark place. But from where they were, it's unbelievable what they've been able to do."""

""The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion,"" they wrote.  ""Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision,"" the Braves said. Freeman said he was surprised the Braves were ""able to use a laptop with their fingers shaking so much from fear of the voting suppression extremists"" and called their press release a textbook definition of the phrase ""tone deaf."" He also hit at the Braves' assertion that Atlanta has ""always been known as a uniter in divided times,"" writing that their claim ""shows a level of historical ignorance that is stunning from people who should know better."" ""Atlanta may have been the center of the   but to say it has always been a 'uniter' is a farce,"" said Freeman. ""No city in the South has always been a 'uniter.'  .""

""But those same people are having their access to voting diminished with a bevy of suppression laws."" Freeman said the new restrictions in the Republican-sponsored legislation are ""draconian"" and, echoing Biden, ""un-American in every way.""  ""Manfred did the right thing in fighting these laws. Every sport, every business in the country, could learn from what Manfred did. They could also learn from the Braves, on what not to do. On what gutlessness looks like,"" he concluded.

""He pretty much did whatever he wanted in that first half,"" Hawks interim coach Nate McMillan said, adding ""we had to stop fouling him. He’s excellent at drawing fouls on the pick-and-rolls. I thought we did a better job of making him work and staying in front of him and showing him a crowd."" Kevin Huerter stole the ball from Curry, and Trae Young fed Capella for a fast-break dunk that made it 67-all at the 6:09 mark of the third. Green followed with a straightaway 3, and the Warriors led until Lou Williams hit consecutive jumpers to give the Hawks an 88-87 lead early in the fourth. There were 16 lead changes and 17 ties before Huerter’s 3 put Atlanta up 100-98. Snell followed with a 3 to make it 103-98, and the Hawks led the rest of the way. Williams hit a fadeaway jumper to make it 105-98, and Golden State didn’t get any closer than two for the remainder of the game. ""The young guys are getting more vocal, especially on the court,"" Gallinari said. ""That’s something that they definitely are doing better compared to the beginning of the season. That’s what we need them to do."" Capela’s layup on a baseline feed from Bogdan Bogdanovic with 41 seconds remaining made it 112-106 and ended the Warriors’ last threat. Golden State started 1 for 12 on 3s before Andrew Wiggins hit two consecutive shots beyond the arc to force a 40-all tie midway through the second. Curry displayed some dazzling ball-handling skills behind the back and scored layups on back-to-back possessions to force a 53-all tie in the final minute before halftime. ""We were competing all game long,"" Golden State's Kelly Oubre Jr. said after scoring 20 points. ""We just fouled too much."" Warriors: Curry is wearing protective padding in his uniform to protect his tailbone. ... Curry scored at least 30 in his third straight game and 20th overall. ... Green, back after missing one game with a left finger injury, had 11 points and 11 assists in 36 minutes. ... F Eric Paschall will miss the next two weeks after an MRI revealed a flexor strain in his left hip. Hawks: McMillan said there was no update on F John Collins, who missed his third straight game with a left ankle sprain. ... F De’Andre Hunter still has no immediate timetable to return from a left knee injury. ... Young, Atlanta’s leading scorer this season, had 13 points after missing Friday’s win at New Orleans with a knee injury. ... Williams finished with 15 points and sparked the second-team offense. Curry wore Bruce Lee-themed shoes in support of the eight people, including six Asian Americans, who were killed in Atlanta-area massage parlors on March 16. Curry plans to auction the shoes off to raise money and awareness for the victims’ families. The yellow high-topped shoes bore an inscription — ""under the sky, under the heavens, there is but one family"" — credited to Lee. ""Steph never ceases to amaze me,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Just the way he wields his influence and he understands the power that he holds. Whether it’s to raise money or raise awareness or just a kind gesture — it’s usually all of the above. He’s just an incredibly thoughtful, self-aware athlete."" Warriors: Host Milwaukee on Tuesday. Hawks: Host New Orleans on Tuesday."

Scrutiny on Fields started when ESPN NFL analyst Dan Orlovsky repeated what he heard from scouts about the former Ohio State quarterback. Orlovsky has since apologized for putting the criticism out there but the comments didn’t sit well with Fields’ former coach. Day defended Fields in an interview with  . At the same time, he took a shot at those who decided to opt out of the 2020 season over fears of the coronavirus. ""The whole idea that he doesn’t have a very good work ethic? I mean, to me, that’s crazy. He got done with the Clemson game [the loss in the college football playoffs in the 2019 season] and he came back and all he did was work to get back to that game. And when those other guys are opting out, what’s he do? He petitions to have a season. ""He put together this petition that the Big Ten athletes all signed saying that they want to play, but they want to play safely and that they don’t accept canceling the season. It was all led by Justin Fields. Where was everybody else? Where were the guys who were opting out then? You know, you don’t love the game if you’re doing something like that. This kid loves the game,"" Day told King for his ""Football Morning in America"" column. ""I heard something about the last one to come in, first one to leave. First off, the scouts weren’t in our building all year. Last one in? Every morning, at least every morning we could be in the building, early, he’s in with [assistant AD for football sports performance] Mickey Marotti. The guys who were self-motivated and could do things on their own, those were the ones who made it. He was unbelievable. He changed his diet, he got stronger. He did better than most."" Day’s comments were criticized on social media. Fields was among the top quarterbacks in college during the 2020 season, with 22 touchdown passes and 2,100 passing yards in eight games. He is set to be among the top quarterbacks taken in this month’s draft."
https://www.foxnews.com//sports/ohtanis-2-way-play-walshs-hrs-lead-angels-past-chisox-7-4,sports,"In the first inning alone, Shohei Ohtani threw a ball nearly 101 mph and hit a homer that jumped off his bat at 115 mph. By the time he left, the  ' two-way star had dazzled on the mound and at the plate in a historic two-way performance. And after Sho-time ended, Jared Walsh put on his own impressive effort to secure another win for the Halos. Ohtani both smashed a 451-foot homer and pitched two-hit ball into the fifth inning, and Walsh hit a walkoff homer to end the Angels' 7-4 victory over the   on Sunday night. ""I'm glad I got one game like this under my belt, and it's going to lead to a lot of confidence for me,"" Ohtani said through his translator. Ohtani reached another milestone in his unique career when he took the mound and occupied the No. 2 slot in the batting order for the Angels. He was just the third pitcher in 45 seasons to hit for himself in a game with the designated hitter available, and the first to bat second since Jack Dunleavy did it for the Cardinals in 1903. Although he lost a three-run lead and narrowly avoided injury in a home plate collision during the fifth inning, Ohtani left both teams amazed by his abilities. ""He’s everything we thought he could be, right?"" Angels manager Joe Maddon said. ""That’s the complete baseball player. He just needed the opportunity to do it. ... What he did tonight was pretty special, and you’re going to see a lot more of that."" Chicago's Leury García put it more succinctly: ""Oh, he nasty."" So was Walsh, who hit two homers — including a big three-run shot off Matt Foster to end the Angels' third win over Chicago in their four-game, season-opening series. In that wild first inning, Ohtani both threw the hardest pitch by any starting pitcher in baseball this season and produced the hardest hit by any batter this season. Ohtani's first-pitch homer off Chicago's Dylan Cease was the hardest-hit homer by the Angels since MLB's Statcast database started tracking in 2015. Even Ohtani's 109.7-mph lineout to center in the second inning was hit harder than any other ball in the game except his own homer. Ohtani didn't allow a run through the first four innings, but his control problems abetted Chicago's three-run rally in the fifth. Ohtani left after a passed ball and a throwing error by catcher Max Stassi led to a collision between Ohtani and AL MVP José Abreu. Ohtani finished with seven strikeouts and five walks, showcasing his typical duo of otherworldly speed and shaky control. David Fletcher and Justin Upton drove in early runs for the Angels. After Chicago tied it in the fifth by scoring three runs without an RBI, Walsh reclaimed the lead for Los Angeles in the fifth — but new Angels closer Raisel Iglesias (1-0) couldn't quite come up with a five-out save. Chicago tied it again in the ninth when Nick Madrigal scored from second on a throwing error by Iglesias, who tried to get him at third after fielding Adam Eaton’s one-out grounder. The White Sox scored four runs despite going 0 for 11 with runners in scoring position. ""I just told them, this is one of the most impressive losses that I can remember being a part of,"" Chicago manager Tony La Russa said. ""You look at all the stuff that went on in that game, and the fact that they didn’t give up is a great sign of the toughness and the guts that this club has as we move forward."" José Ruiz (0-1) gave up a leadoff single in the ninth to Dexter Fowler, who entered the game via a rare AL double switch. White Sox: SS Tim Anderson grounded out leading off the first inning, and he didn't take the field for the bottom half due to left hamstring tightness. La Russa said they don't think the injury is serious. Angels: Ohtani left the game with general soreness, but no injury, general manager Perry Minasian said. ""I feel fine as of now,"" Ohtani said. ""It wasn’t as bad as it looked."" Ohtani even mastered Yermín Mercedes, the 28-year-old White Sox rookie who improbably got his first eight major league hits consecutively over the past two games. Ohtani struck out Mercedes in the second and fourth innings, dropping the designated hitter’s average all the way down to .727. Mercedes beat out an infield single later for his ninth hit in three games. White Sox: Carlos Rodon takes the mound in Seattle on Monday when they open a three-game series with the Mariners. Angels: José Quintana makes his Halos debut Monday when they open a two-game series with the Houston Astros."

""A lot of teams that get down by 18 in the first half, they would just let go of the rope, they would just give up,"" Gordon argued. Not these guys. ""It’s a testament,"" he said, ""to where this team can go."" Gordon scored Denver's first dozen points, then helped the Nuggets erase an 18-point halftime deficit for their 14th win in 17 games and their 10th straight over the Magic. ""Poor offense, poor defense, poor effort,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said of his team's awful first half, which he called ""our worst half of the season."" Which was followed by a masterpiece. ""It was great to see the comeback, but I'd rather see 48 minutes"" of that kind of basketball, Malone said. Jamal Murray added 22 points and Michael Porter Jr. 20 for Denver, which got 17 points, 16 assists and nine rebounds from Nikola Jokic. Chuma Okeke and Terrence Ross led Orlando with 19 points each. Rookie R.J. Hampton, who was dealt by Denver in the Gordon trade, scored 16 points, including Orlando's first seven. ""It was definitely fun to see those guys and compete against those guys,"" Hampton said. ""They're a great basketball team."" Malone said before tip-off that he didn’t have to give Gordon any advice about keeping his emotions in check going against his former team that dealt him to Denver last week after seven seasons in Orlando. But he did admonish his team not to take Orlando lightly because they're a rebuilding team, one that's also riddled by injuries and illnesses. ""If we think we can just show up because we’re playing a team that doesn’t have maybe a marquee name, we’re going to find ourselves in a ballgame,"" Malone warned. They sure did. The Nuggets trailed by double digits for most of the first half, and after cutting their deficit to 54-47, they surrendered the final 11 points of the second quarter and trailed 65-47 at halftime. Denver erased all of that in the third quarter before Ross put Orlando back on top 86-85 with a jumper in the closing seconds. But the Nuggets pulled away in the final minutes for their fourth consecutive win since the big trade for Gordon. Magic coach Steve Clifford called his team’s injury epidemic ""like nothing I’ve ever been through before as a head coach or an assistant."" Sidelined against Denver were: Cole Anthony (ribs), Michael Carter-Williams (non-COVID illness), Markelle Fultz (left ACL), Harris (strained left adductor), Karim Mane (hamstring) and Otto Porter Jr. (left foot). Limited were Chasson Randle (hamstring), James Ennis III (non-COVID-illness) and Mo Bamba (non-COVID illness). Nuggets: The Nuggets played a video tribute to Harris in the second quarter, which earned him a standing ovation from the 4,050 fans at Ball Arena in the   since before the pandemic hit last year (employees and front-line workers were at last game). Hampton, a rookie, got his video tribute later in the quarter. ... Denver was outshot in the first half 57 percent to 39 percent. Magic: Hosts the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night.

But Baylor had some coronavirus issues at the start of the season forcing them to cancel some games and later postpone others. Those issues are far behind Baylor and they will finally get a chance to take down the No. 1 team in the nation. Gonzaga is looking to make history. The Bulldogs can be the first Division I men’s basketball team to finish a season undefeated since Indiana went 32-0 with a national championship in 1975-76. Indiana State in 1979, UNLV in 1991, Wichita State in 2014 and Kentucky in 2015 entered previous tournaments undefeated only to drop a game in the postseason. Gonzaga could also be the first non-Power Conference school to win a national championship since UNLV won the title in 1990. The Runnin’ Rebels were in the Big West Conference at the time. Gonzaga is a member of the West Coast Conference. Baylor has been known more for its women’s basketball program than it’s men’s basketball program. The school has never won a men’s basketball title. The team was in the championship in 1948 but lost to Kentucky in the game. They hadn’t been back since. The Bears have had a solid run recently and the 2020-21 season was their best season in a while. Baylor was 27-2 overall and 13-1 in the Big 12 Conference and now have a chance to end their championshipless streak. Baylor beat Hartford, Wisconsin, Villanova, Arkansas and Houston to get to the finals. MaCio Teague and Jared Butler have been the top players on the team. Gonzaga beat Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton, USC and UCLA to get to the final. Their Final Four matchup against Bruins has been regarded as one of the top tournament games in recent memory.

On Monday, Jobs Creators Network CEO   joined   to discuss how the ""economic damages"" of MLB’s move acts as another blow to the city’s economy, following the   pandemic and the threat of higher corporate taxes and federal regulation from the Biden administration.  ""[Georgia] is barely making it out of this pandemic,"" Ortiz said. ""And now they’re faced, under the Biden administration, with potentially higher taxes, a higher minimum wage, more red tape and regulations, and now this."" Ortiz said the economic benefit of the game was an ""opportunity"" for small businesses in Cobb County, particularly minority-owned businesses, to generate much-needed revenue for an already strained city economy.  The CEO added that mounting   on the MLB to pull the game out of Georgia was due to a ""misrepresentation"" or an ""outright lie"" regarding the controversial voting law recently passed in the state.  ""The bottom line is that law, it just makes it easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" Ortiz told  Ortiz laid the blame on   and CEOs perpetuating the ""myth"" that led to the pullout by MLB. ""I expect that out of politicians and political talking heads and operatives, like   or   but I just don’t expect that out of our CEOs or corporations that I think should be held to a higher standard and need to be held accountable.""

https://www.foxnews.com//media/trump-biden-fauci-birx-why-finger-pointing-is-surging-as-covid-19-cases-rise,politics,"Just as more Americans are getting vaccines, two fierce battles have broken out about Covid-19—one about the current danger and the other about the last administration. It often seems that our political war over the pandemic consumes more energy than fighting the virus itself. And people are understandably confused about the nature of the tunnel we’re in and whether we can see any light at its end. President Biden is once again pleading with people against a premature declaration of victory. And former president Trump is denouncing two of his top medical advisers for criticizing his handling of the crisis, as part of an effort to salvage their own reputations. All this is unfolding as the director of the Centers for Disease Control is warning of ""impending doom."" While there is much reason for hope, says Rochelle Walensky, ""right now, I’m scared."" Scared of a fourth wave of the virus in the next couple of months before a majority of the country is vaccinated. And, by implication, scared of governors, especially Republicans, lifting mask mandates and business restrictions. ""Please, this is not politics—reinstate the mandate,"" Biden said. But of course, these are political decisions, balancing health risks and the need to revive the economy. But the argument over what to do now rests in part on how we got here, 550,000 American deaths later. Trump issued a blistering statement about Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, former leaders of his virus task force, ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations… if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression."" The former president was triggered, to use a woke term, by Birx’s interview in a CNN documentary, and the continuing media blitz by Fauci, who is now Biden’s top Covid adviser. But Trump, as is his wont, went well beyond policy to rip the doctors personally. He said that Birx, a ""terrible medical adviser,"" is ""a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as ""pseudo-science,"" and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and, in fact, would ask not to be in the same room with her."" Trump also cited an incident when Birx went to visit family on Thanksgiving after urging the public not to travel. As for Fauci, Trump remains fixated on the 78-year-old having thrown out a lousy first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. Fauci ""said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a ‘roller.’"" He also said Fauci had done a ""fake"" interview on CNN—I don’t know, I saw him on camera—and that ""the king of ‘flip-flops’ and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."" So what did the two of them say? Birx told CNN there was an ""excuse"" for the first 100,00 deaths from the original surge, but ""all of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" She said she had a ""very uncomfortable"" call with Trump last summer after warning about the virus on the network and was told she had to stay off national TV ""because the president might see it."" Birx is drawing enormous flak for speaking out now, when it’s too late, rather than challenging Trump when she had some authority. Some say she should have quit, though it’s not clear what that would have accomplished. Fauci told CNN that Birx should have done more but was in a difficult situation. Fauci is seen as having diplomatically battled the president last year and has been through many of these cycles. After the infection disease expert did a ""60 Minutes"" interview last October, Trump called him a ""disaster"" and said ""people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots."" Today, by contrast, Biden backs Walensky when she says things like ""impending doom."" But is it impending? The plateau period is over. The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, says the Washington Post. In nine states, the jump has been more than 40 percent in two weeks, says the New York Times. Michigan alone has seen a 57 rise in Covid cases, and a 47 percent increase in hospitalizations, in the past week. I have no doubt that much of this is tied to the warmer weather, spring break gatherings and pent-up frustrations over the past year. Virus variants may also be a factor, as well as states such as Michigan easier limits on business activity. In short, it would be a shame after a year of isolation and lockdown if we had another surge just as enough vaccines are becoming available to protect most Americans by May or June. But there are tradeoffs, as there have been since the dawn of the pandemic. In the end, Biden—and the governors—will be judged on how they handle this crucial period, just as Trump and his advisers were judged on 2020."
https://www.foxnews.com//media/biden-uses-espn-to-slam-georgia-voting-law-wants-all-star-game-moved,politics,"Barack Obama went on ESPN to unveil his March Madness brackets. Donald Trump regularly attacked NFL players for their anthem protests. And now Joe Biden is taking a swing at it. In an interview on ESPN’s ""Sports Center,"" Biden made news by backing efforts to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta as a protest against Georgia’s new voting law. It’s striking that co-host Sage Steele chose to ask about the controversial law, which Biden described as ""Jim Crow on steroids."" In the past, ESPN has drawn flak for being too political and too liberal, particularly when it came to Trump. Former host Jemele Hill caused an uproar when she attacked the former president as a white supremacist. But there is an effort by the baseball players’ union to use the All-Star Game to punish Georgia, whose restrictions on voting and ID requirements for mail ballots were signed into law last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. So Steele may have had little choice but to raise a controversy in which politics and sports had already melded. While Trump, a onetime USFL team owner, was often at odds with pro athletes—some of whom refused to make the traditional White House visit when they won a championship—Biden is eager to side with the players. ""I think today’s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,"" he told the network. ""People look to them. They’re leaders."" There is some precedent, as the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of Charlotte in 2017 to protest a North Carolina law limiting anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. In setting up another question for the president, Steele noted that Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has repealed his state’s mask mandate. He asked about the decision by the Texas Rangers to allow its stadium to be filled to capacity for its home opener Monday—more than 40,000 people--although masks would be required except when eating. ""That’s a decision they made,"" said Biden. ""I think it’s a mistake. They should listen to Dr. Fauci and the scientists and the experts, but I think it’s not responsible."" Most baseball franchises are limiting attendance. In the latest sign that MLB isn’t any more immune from this virus this season than the last one, yesterday’s Washington Nationals game against the New York Mets was postponed after five people in the Nats organization tested positive for Covid. Trump made his attacks on pro football players into part of the culture wars. In one tweet four years ago, he pulled a page from ""The Apprentice"": ""If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!"" Another time, the 45th president wrote: ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired.’"" Trump also told Mike Pence to leave an Indianapolis Colts game if a number of players took a knee, which the vice president did. And Trump taunted the league when the ratings declined. Also in 2017, Trump withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors after Steph Curry and others criticized him. The team visited Obama instead. It’s hardly shocking that Biden, a self-proclaimed ""union guy,"" would back the baseball players’ union. The All-Star controversy was also a slow pitch over the plate for him, given his repeated denunciations of the Georgia voting law. But Biden is unlikely to insert himself into numerous sports controversies. Meanwhile, Georgia politicians are also taking a baseball bat to major corporations. After Delta’s CEO slammed the voting law as ""unacceptable,"" the state House passed a bill repealing the airline’s tax break on jet fuel."
https://www.foxnews.com//media/media-root-for-bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-casting-him-as-fdr,politics,"Hey, is it finally Infrastructure Week? It’s not the sexiest topic, certainly not compared to the bizarre Matt Gaetz investigation or even the Biden dog biting someone again after a stint in reeducation camp. That’s why it became a running joke during the Trump administration, when plans to highlight such an initiative kept getting overshadowed by some controversy or scandal. But President Biden made it the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh speech yesterday, unveiling a plan that will cost, oh, more than $2 trillion—more, in other words, than his just-passed Covid relief bill. Now I’m a fan of infrastructure projects, which help communities, create jobs and can be popular with both parties in a bringing-home-the-bacon kind of way. But the passage of this bill is a crapshoot. Yet some major news outlets are absolutely swooning. Take this headline  : ""With an Eye on History, Biden Moves on Big, Bold and Progressive Infrastructure Package."" Doesn’t that sound like it’s ripped from a White House press release? The piece begins: ""Every day he works from the Oval Office, President Joe Biden stares across from his desk at the portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt he selected to hang above his fireplace."" In case you missed the point: ""Biden hopes to model the more transformational change offered by his acronym'd 20th-century predecessors, FDR and LBJ…He envisions a moment--one where a country ravaged by the pandemic has seen fragilities in the economy exacerbated to a level of unseen hardship--where he can usher in a transformative era…Biden is deeply conscious that it is now his moment to step up."" Do you have the vague impression that CNN is rooting for the president? Okay, it’s historic, it’s filled with goodies, it has echoes of the New Deal. But it’s a massive amount of money and may not pass. The  uses a torrent of statistics to spotlight the plan’s benefits, from mass transit and Amtrak to broadband. That ""would translate into 20,000 miles of rebuilt roads, repairs to the 10 most economically important bridges in the country, the elimination of lead pipes and service lines from the nation’s water supplies and a long list of other projects intended to create millions of jobs in the short run and strengthen American competitiveness in the long run. ""Biden administration officials said the proposal...would also accelerate the fight against climate change by hastening the shift to new, cleaner energy sources, and would help promote racial equity in the economy…The scale of the proposal underscores how fully Mr. Biden has embraced the opportunity to use federal spending to address longstanding social and economic challenges in a way not seen in half a century."" That’s an LBJ reference, if you didn’t do the math. Not until the seventh paragraph does the Times inject this note of reality: ""While spending on roads, bridges and other physical improvements to the nation’s economic foundations has always had bipartisan appeal, Mr. Biden’s plan is sure to draw intense Republican opposition, both for its sheer size and for its reliance on corporate tax increases to pay for it."" Which could, of course, sink the whole thing. Contrast that article with the  . Its headline says: ""White House Unveils $2 Trillion Infrastructure and Climate Plan, Setting Up Giant Battle Over Size and Cost of Government."" At least that gets across there’s a major fight that has two sides. By the third paragraph, the Post cautions: ""The administration’s promises are vast and may prove difficult to enact, even if the effort can get through Democrats’ extremely narrow majority in Congress."" Look, with a 50-50 Senate, Biden can’t pass anything of this scale, even through reconciliation, unless Joe Manchin agrees. And the key question is how to pay for it. Not everyone on the Hill is excited about raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The White House was smart to put out the details before Biden’s speech and frame the issue in advance. But that doesn’t mean the media have to pile on the FDR references and help sell the bill."

Biden has called the   ""a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience,"" likened it to ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" erroneously said that it polliing sites would close at 5 p.m., and supported Major League Baseball moving the 2021 All-Star Game from the state as a response. Christie, who is on the New York Mets board of directors, pointed to how the law provides for more than two weeks of early voting including weekend hours, allows for multiple forms of voter verifications, allows polls to remain open until 7 p.m., and requires counties to have ballot drop boxes. ""I sat here and listened to the president’s inaugural address,"" Christie, a Republican, told ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos Sunday on ABC. ""A couple of real quick points from it: politics need not be a raging fire that destroys everything in its path, every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war, and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated or made up. And Joe Biden’s broken his own rule, 84 days. And now he’s lying to the American people, George. He’s lying about this bill, he’s lying to the American people about it to cause the raging fire he said he was going to put out."" Christie continued, saying that on Easter morning the Catholic president had to live being a ""hypocrite"" by doing what he accused his predecessor of doing. ""Here’s what Joe Biden’s got to live with when he wakes up this morning on Easter morning. He is doing exactly what he sat around in the campaign and the transition and accused Donald Trump of doing. He is lying to cause racial divisions in this country. That’s what he accused Donald Trump of doing, and he’s a liar and a hypocrite this morning."" Christie also pointed to how Georgia Democratic voting activist Stacey Abrams praised his home state of New Jersey for passing voting measures that he said do not even allow as much access as Georgia's. ""Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days — half of what Georgia’s is,"" Christie said. ""Yet she’s on TV in New Jersey — I saw it myself — saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we’ve ever seen,"" Christie said. ""I am so excited to be looking up, looking at New Jersey, knowing that New Jersey is taking us in the right direction,"" Abrams said in a virtual event with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday.

The CDC also said that the setting of the sporting event or activity was important, noting that indoor activites pose more risk than outdoor activities, and pointed to the size of the team, sharing of equipment and limiting travel outside of the local community. The CDC urged local youth sports and activity organizations to clean and disinfect surfaces on the fields, courts, or equipment and other shared objects, enforce mask wearing, limit team sizes and practice physical distancing."

https://www.foxnews.com//politics/biden-spending-bill-gop-criticism,politics," on Monday said he will ""push as hard"" as he can to get his $2 trillion spending bill through  , despite criticism from Republican lawmakers about its size and the contents of the package. Biden, returning to the White House from a weekend at Camp David on Monday, spoke about his infrastructure package, which the White House rolled out last week. .""Let me say something,"" the president said, referring to Republican scrutiny of the package. ""Their definition of infrastructure has changed. They know we need it."" ""I am going to push as hard as I can to compete with the rest of the world,"" Biden continued. ""Everyone around the world invests billions in infrastructure, and we're going to do it here."" The White House is framing the $2 trillion spending proposal, called the American Jobs Plan, as an investment in a very broad definition of infrastructure that will modernize the U.S.'s economy and uplift those who are struggling the most. ""It's time to build our economy from the bottom-up and the middle-out, not the top-down,"" Biden said in remarks unveiling the plan in Pittsburgh last week. ""And this time when we rebuild the middle class, we're going to bring everybody along regardless of your background, your color, your religion, where everybody gets to come along."" The White House's spending breakdown of its plan, it says, includes $620 billion for roads, bridges and ports; $400 billion for elderly home care; $580 billion on job training, R&D and clean energy; and $650 billion on the electric grid, broadband and water systems.In the $620 billion for roads bridges and ports, the White House lumps in $174 billion for electric vehicles — more than it is spending on any other individual item in that category. In order to pay for this legislation, Biden also proposed what he has called the Made in America Tax Plan, which would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. It would also increase the minimum tax on multinational corporations to 21% and ""calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens,"" alongside several other efforts to eliminate perceived loopholes in the corporate tax code. But Republicans have slammed the proposal claiming it directs unde rhalf of its totla money to things traditionally defined as infrastructure. ""This plan is not about rebuilding America’s backbone. Less than 6% of this massive proposal goes to roads and bridges,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. ""It would spend more money just on electric cars than on America’s roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined."" The White House summary of the American Jobs Plan says it will spend ""$115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair"" out of more than $2 trillion in the plan.Other items that counted to reach a total of just under $750 billion included $50 billion to preserve infrastructure resilience, $80 billion for Amtrak and $20 billion for road safety. The White House and press secretary Jen Psaki have indicated that they are open to negotiating with Republicans over Biden's spending plan. But it remains unclear how much Democrats would actually be willing to compromise on in order to secure Republican votes. If Republicans and Democrats cannot come to the kind of agreement that can get the support of 10 Republicans and reach the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate, Democrats will likely be forced to move the package ahead via budget reconciliation. That process allows them to circumvent the filibuster and therefore avoid negotiating with Republicans. ""I support improving America’s aging roads, bridges, ports, and other infrastructure. And we can do so in a bipartisan way,"" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said last week. But, he said, Biden's plan includes ""these broad policy priorities that are a far cry away from what we’ve ever defined as infrastructure."""

""Your administration is not doing enough to stop this crisis, and it is critical that the Fiscal Year 2022 budget request that you are currently developing includes sufficient resources for [ICE] detention and removal operations,"" Hagerty wrote in a letter to Biden. ""I strongly urge your administration not to cave to unfounded political pressure to defund ICE."" The Biden administration has been dealing with a dramatic spike in migrant apprehensions at the border. Preliminary Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data   that the agency is on pace to have encountered more than 171,000 migrants in March. While many of those are single adults and can be expelled due to Title 42 public health protections, unaccompanied children cannot, and Mexico is refusing to take migrant families with tender-aged children (under 7 years old) -- leading to migrants being released into the U.S. -- sometimes   reported last week that the number of illegal immigrants sneaking past overwhelmed Border Patrol agents is the highest in recent memory, with more than 1,000 migrants a day getting in. While CBP is one of the primary agencies dealing with the crisis, along with Health and Human Services, Hagerty argues that this will also require more work from ICE. ""Given the rapidly increasing number of border crossings, you must request funding levels that far exceed those provided this fiscal year if you intend to empower law enforcement personnel to secure the border and protect American communities,"" Hagerty wrote in the letter to Biden. ""If, on the other hand, you fail to request the ICE enforcement and removal funding necessary to meet this crisis, you will essentially be adopting a policy of defunding, and ultimately abolishing, ICE."" The Biden administration has been   from Republicans for what they say is a crisis caused by the loosening or abolition of Trump-era policies like the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) and halting wall construction. Additionally, the administration sought to impose a moratorium on deportations, which was blocked after a lawsuit. It has since   and removal priorities to focus on national security threats, aggravated felons and recent border crossers, something the administration claims will make the agency more effective. However, on the other end of the political spectrum, left-wing Democrats who promoted the ""abolish ICE"" movement are still pushing for more radical measures ""If you don’t want children in cages, then you need to stop upholding CBP, ICE, and the military as the solution to this crisis,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY,  . In his letter, Hagerty argued that a rise in border crossings will ultimately lead to an increase of those in ICE custody, pointing to numbers from the 2019 crisis. ""I urge you to heed these warning signs and include in your upcoming budget request a significant increase in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations,"" he writes. ""If your administration fails to do so, it will be demonstrating greater loyalty to far-left anti-law enforcement politics than to enforcing the law and protecting American communities."" Biden has stood by his rollback of Trump-era policies, saying he makes ""no apologies"" for reversing policies he says are cruel -- and has downplayed the numbers coming to the border. ""It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year,"" he said at a recent press conference."
